    "Due __Dec 8, 2023__ by __11:59pm__. Submit your work by uploading it to Gradescope. \n",
    "\n",
    "Please rename this file as __\"LastName_FirstName_hw5\"__ and export it as as pdf-file. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Provide your solutions in new cells following each exercise description. Create as many new cells as necessary. Use code cells for your Python scripts and Markdown cells for explanatory text or answers to non-coding questions. Answer all textual questions in complete sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Prioritize code readability. Just as in writing a book, the clarity of each line matters. Adopt the __one-statement-per-line__ rule. If you have a lengthy code statement, consider breaking it into multiple lines for clarity. (Please note: violating the one-statement-per-line rule will result in a one-point deduction for each offending line.)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. To help understand and maintain code, you should always add comments to explain your code. Use the hash symbol (#) to start writing a comment (homework without any comments will automatically receive 0 points).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Submit your final work as a __.pdf__ file on __Gradescope__. To convert your .ipynb file into one of these formats, navigate to \"File\", select \"Download as\", and then choose either \"PDF via LaTeX\" or \"HTML\". If \"PDF via LaTeX\" does not work for you, export to \"HTML\", and then use Chrome to print the .html file into PDF. Gradescope only accepts PDF files.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. This assignment will be graded on your proficiency in programming. Be sure to demonstrate your abilities and submit your own, correct and readable solutions. \n",
    "\n",
    "__For full credit, query the correct table with `pd.read_sql` with SQL. Do not subset, group, sort, aggregate, ect. via `pandas`.__"
