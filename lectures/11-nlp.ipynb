    "### Natural Language Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "A _natural language_ is a language people use to communicate, like English, Spanish, or Mandarin. These languages evolved over thousands of years and do not have simple, explicit rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Natural language processing_ (NLP) means using a computer to analyze, manipulate, or synthesize natural language. Some examples of NLP tasks are:\n",
    "* Translating from one language to another\n",
    "* Recognizing speech or handwriting\n",
    "* Tagging sentences with metadata, such as parts of speech (verbs, nouns, etc) or sentiment\n",
    "* Extracting information or computing statistics from text\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to artificial languages like Python and XML, it's much more difficult to extract information from natural languages. NLP is a wide field; we only have time to learn the absolute basics. If you want to learn more, consider reading the entire [Natural Language Processing with Python][nlpp] book or taking a class in computational linguistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "[nlpp]: https://www.nltk.org/book/\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Python NLP Ecosystem\n",
    "\n",
    "There are lots of Python packages for NLP (try searching online)! A few popular ones are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Natural Language Tool Kit][nltk] (`nltk`) is the most popular. It's designed for learning and research, so it's well-documented and has lots of features. We will use `nltk` for this class. \n",
    "* [TextBlob][textblob] is a \"simplified\" package. It has a nicer interface than NLTK, but less features.\n",
    "* [SpaCy][spacy] is a \"production-ready\" package, and the fastest of all the packages listed here. Useful for working with large natural language datasets.\n",
    "* [gensim][gensim] is a package for creating topic models, which are a kind of statistical model that predict the topics of a text.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to learn `nltk`, but you might want to try some of the others if your project involves NLP.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Stanford's Core NLP][CoreNLP] library is at the cutting edge of NLP research. It's developed in Java, but several Python packages provide an interface (such as [pynlp][] and [stanford-corenlp][]).\n",

    "#### Corpora and Documents\n",
    "\n",
    "A _document_ is a single body text. When working with natural language data, documents are the unit of observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "What you choose as a document depends on the purpose of your analysis. If you're studying how people react to news on Twitter, it makes sense to use individual tweets as documents. If you're studying how animals are portrayed in 19th-century literature, you could use individual novels as documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "A _corpus_ is a collection of documents. In other words, a corpus is a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "`nltk` provides some example corpora in the `nltk.corpus` submodule. The documentation gives a [complete list](http://www.nltk.org/nltk_data/). Most have to be downloaded with `nltk.download()` before use."

Some years ago--never mind how long\\r\\nprecisely--having little or no money in my purse, and nothing\\r\\nparticular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a\\r\\nlittle and see the watery part of the world.  It is a way I have of\\r\\ndriving off the spleen and regulating the circulation.  Whenever I\\r\\nfind myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp,\\r\\ndrizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily\\r\\npausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every\\r\\nfuneral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper\\r\\nhand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me\\r\\nfrom deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking\\r\\npeople\\'s hats off--then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon\\r\\nas I can.  This is my substitute for pistol and ball.  With a\\r\\nphilosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly\\r\\ntake to the ship.  There is nothing surprising in this.  If they but\\r\\nknew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish\\r\\nvery nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by\\r\\nwharves as Indian isles by coral reefs--commerce surrounds it with\\r\\nher surf.  Right and left, the streets take you waterward.  Its\\r\\nextreme downtown is the battery, where that noble mole is washed by\\r\\nwaves, and cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were out of\\r\\nsight of land.  Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.\\r\\n\\r\\nCircumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon.  Go from\\r\\nCorlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall,\\r\\nnorthward.  What do you see?--Posted like silent sentinels all around\\r\\nthe town, stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean\\r\\nreveries.  Some leaning against the spiles; some seated upon the\\r\\npier-heads; some looking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some\\r\\nhigh aloft in the rigging, as if striving to get a still better\\r\\nseaward peep.  But these are all landsmen; of week days pent up in\\r\\nlath and plaster--tied to counters, nailed to benches, clinched to\\r\\ndesks.  How then is this?  Are the green fields gone?  What do they\\r\\nhere?\\r\\n\\r\\nBut look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and\\r\\nseemingly bound for a dive.  Strange!  Nothing will content them but\\r\\nthe extremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of\\r\\nyonder warehouses will not suffice.  No.  They must get just as nigh\\r\\nthe water as they possibly can without falling in.  And there they\\r\\nstand--miles of them--leagues.  Inlanders all, they come from lanes\\r\\nand alleys, streets and avenues--north, east, south, and west.  Yet\\r\\nhere they all unite.  Tell me, does the magnetic virtue of the\\r\\nneedles of the compasses of all those ships attract them thither?\\r\\n\\r\\nOnce more.  Say you are in the country; in some high land of lakes.\\r\\nTake almost any path you please, and ten to one it carries you down\\r\\nin a dale, and leaves you there by a pool in the stream.  There is\\r\\nmagic in it.  Let the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his\\r\\ndeepest reveries--stand that man on his legs, set his feet a-going,\\r\\nand he will infallibly lead you to water, if water there be in all\\r\\nthat region.  Should you ever be athirst in the great American\\r\\ndesert, try this experiment, if your caravan happen to be supplied\\r\\nwith a metaphysical professor.  Yes, as every one knows, meditation\\r\\nand water are wedded for ever.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut here is an artist.  He desires to paint you the dreamiest,\\r\\nshadiest, quietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all\\r\\nthe valley of the Saco.  What is the chief element he employs?  There\\r\\nstand his trees, each with a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a\\r\\ncrucifix were within; and here sleeps his meadow, and there sleep his\\r\\ncattle; and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke.  Deep into\\r\\ndistant woodlands winds a mazy way, reaching to overlapping spurs of\\r\\nmountains bathed in their hill-side blue.  But though the picture\\r\\nlies thus tranced, and though this pine-tree shakes down its sighs\\r\\nlike leaves upon this shepherd\\'s head, yet all were vain, unless the\\r\\nshepherd\\'s eye were fixed upon the magic stream before him.  Go visit\\r\\nthe Prairies in June, when for scores on scores of miles you wade\\r\\nknee-deep among Tiger-lilies--what is the one charm\\r\\nwanting?--Water--there is not a drop of water there!  Were Niagara\\r\\nbut a cataract of sand, would you travel your thousand miles to see\\r\\nit?  Why did the poor poet of Tennessee, upon suddenly receiving two\\r\\nhandfuls of silver, deliberate whether to buy him a coat, which he\\r\\nsadly needed, or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to Rockaway\\r\\nBeach?  Why is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy\\r\\nsoul in him, at some time or other crazy to go to sea?  Why upon your\\r\\nfirst voyage as a passenger, did you yourself feel such a mystical\\r\\nvibration, when first told that you and your ship were now out of\\r\\nsight of land?  Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy?  Why did\\r\\nthe Greeks give it a separate deity, and own brother of Jove?  Surely\\r\\nall this is not without meaning.  And still deeper the meaning of\\r\\nthat story of Narcissus, who because he could not grasp the\\r\\ntormenting, mild image he saw in the fountain, plunged into it and\\r\\nwas drowned.  But that same image, we ourselves see in all rivers and\\r\\noceans.  It is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life; and this\\r\\nis the key to it all.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I\\r\\nbegin to grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of\\r\\nmy lungs, I do not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as\\r\\na passenger.  For to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse,\\r\\nand a purse is but a rag unless you have something in it.  Besides,\\r\\npassengers get sea-sick--grow quarrelsome--don\\'t sleep of nights--do\\r\\nnot enjoy themselves much, as a general thing;--no, I never go as a\\r\\npassenger; nor, though I am something of a salt, do I ever go to sea\\r\\nas a Commodore, or a Captain, or a Cook.  I abandon the glory and\\r\\ndistinction of such offices to those who like them.  For my part, I\\r\\nabominate all honourable respectable toils, trials, and tribulations\\r\\nof every kind whatsoever.  It is quite as much as I can do to take\\r\\ncare of myself, without taking care of ships, barques, brigs,\\r\\nschooners, and what not.  And as for going as cook,--though I confess\\r\\nthere is considerable glory in that, a cook being a sort of officer\\r\\non ship-board--yet, somehow, I never fancied broiling fowls;--though\\r\\nonce broiled, judiciously buttered, and judgmatically salted and\\r\\npeppered, there is no one who will speak more respectfully, not to\\r\\nsay reverentially, of a broiled fowl than I will.  It is out of the\\r\\nidolatrous dotings of the old Egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted\\r\\nriver horse, that you see the mummies of those creatures in their\\r\\nhuge bake-houses the pyramids.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the mast,\\r\\nplumb down into the forecastle, aloft there to the royal mast-head.\\r\\nTrue, they rather order me about some, and make me jump from spar to\\r\\nspar, like a grasshopper in a May meadow.  And at first, this sort of\\r\\nthing is unpleasant enough.  It touches one\\'s sense of honour,\\r\\nparticularly if you come of an old established family in the land,\\r\\nthe Van Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes.  And more than\\r\\nall, if just previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot, you have\\r\\nbeen lording it as a country schoolmaster, making the tallest boys\\r\\nstand in awe of you.  The transition is a keen one, I assure you,\\r\\nfrom a schoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong decoction of\\r\\nSeneca and the Stoics to enable you to grin and bear it.  But even\\r\\nthis wears off in time.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a\\r\\nbroom and sweep down the decks?  What does that indignity amount to,\\r\\nweighed, I mean, in the scales of the New Testament?  Do you think\\r\\nthe archangel Gabriel thinks anything the less of me, because I\\r\\npromptly and respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular\\r\\ninstance?  Who ain\\'t a slave?  Tell me that.  Well, then, however the\\r\\nold sea-captains may order me about--however they may thump and punch\\r\\nme about, I have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right;\\r\\nthat everybody else is one way or other served in much the same\\r\\nway--either in a physical or metaphysical point of view, that is; and\\r\\nso the universal thump is passed round, and all hands should rub each\\r\\nother\\'s shoulder-blades, and be content.\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain, I always go to sea as a sailor, because they make a point of\\r\\npaying me for my trouble, whereas they never pay passengers a single\\r\\npenny that I ever heard of.  On the contrary, passengers themselves\\r\\nmust pay.  And there is all the difference in the world between\\r\\npaying and being paid.  The act of paying is perhaps the most\\r\\nuncomfortable infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon\\r\\nus.  But BEING PAID,--what will compare with it?  The urbane activity\\r\\nwith which a man receives money is really marvellous, considering\\r\\nthat we so earnestly believe money to be the root of all earthly\\r\\nills, and that on no account can a monied man enter heaven.  Ah! how\\r\\ncheerfully we consign ourselves to perdition!\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the wholesome\\r\\nexercise and pure air of the fore-castle deck.  For as in this world,\\r\\nhead winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern (that is, if\\r\\nyou never violate the Pythagorean maxim), so for the most part the\\r\\nCommodore on the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from\\r\\nthe sailors on the forecastle.  He thinks he breathes it first; but\\r\\nnot so.  In much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in\\r\\nmany other things, at the same time that the leaders little suspect\\r\\nit.  But wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea\\r\\nas a merchant sailor, I should now take it into my head to go on a\\r\\nwhaling voyage; this the invisible police officer of the Fates, who\\r\\nhas the constant surveillance of me, and secretly dogs me, and\\r\\ninfluences me in some unaccountable way--he can better answer than\\r\\nany one else.  And, doubtless, my going on this whaling voyage,\\r\\nformed part of the grand programme of Providence that was drawn up a\\r\\nlong time ago.  It came in as a sort of brief interlude and solo\\r\\nbetween more extensive performances.  I take it that this part of the\\r\\nbill must have run something like this:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\"GRAND CONTESTED ELECTION FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES.\\r\\n\"WHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL.\\r\\n\"BLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThough I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers,\\r\\nthe Fates, put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage, when\\r\\nothers were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies, and\\r\\nshort and easy parts in genteel comedies, and jolly parts in\\r\\nfarces--though I cannot tell why this was exactly; yet, now that I\\r\\nrecall all the circumstances, I think I can see a little into the\\r\\nsprings and motives which being cunningly presented to me under\\r\\nvarious disguises, induced me to set about performing the part I did,\\r\\nbesides cajoling me into the delusion that it was a choice resulting\\r\\nfrom my own unbiased freewill and discriminating judgment.\\r\\n\\r\\nChief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great\\r\\nwhale himself.  Such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all\\r\\nmy curiosity.  Then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his\\r\\nisland bulk; the undeliverable, nameless perils of the whale; these,\\r\\nwith all the attending marvels of a thousand Patagonian sights and\\r\\nsounds, helped to sway me to my wish.  With other men, perhaps, such\\r\\nthings would not have been inducements; but as for me, I am tormented\\r\\nwith an everlasting itch for things remote.  I love to sail forbidden\\r\\nseas, and land on barbarous coasts.  Not ignoring what is good, I am\\r\\nquick to perceive a horror, and could still be social with it--would\\r\\nthey let me--since it is but well to be on friendly terms with all\\r\\nthe inmates of the place one lodges in.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage was welcome; the\\r\\ngreat flood-gates of the wonder-world swung open, and in the wild\\r\\nconceits that swayed me to my purpose, two and two there floated into\\r\\nmy inmost soul, endless processions of the whale, and, mid most of\\r\\nthem all, one grand hooded phantom, like a snow hill in the air.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 2\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Carpet-Bag.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag, tucked it under my\\r\\narm, and started for Cape Horn and the Pacific.  Quitting the good\\r\\ncity of old Manhatto, I duly arrived in New Bedford.  It was a\\r\\nSaturday night in December.  Much was I disappointed upon learning\\r\\nthat the little packet for Nantucket had already sailed, and that no\\r\\nway of reaching that place would offer, till the following Monday.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop\\r\\nat this same New Bedford, thence to embark on their voyage, it may as\\r\\nwell be related that I, for one, had no idea of so doing.  For my\\r\\nmind was made up to sail in no other than a Nantucket craft, because\\r\\nthere was a fine, boisterous something about everything connected\\r\\nwith that famous old island, which amazingly pleased me.  Besides\\r\\nthough New Bedford has of late been gradually monopolising the\\r\\nbusiness of whaling, and though in this matter poor old Nantucket is\\r\\nnow much behind her, yet Nantucket was her great original--the Tyre\\r\\nof this Carthage;--the place where the first dead American whale was\\r\\nstranded.  Where else but from Nantucket did those aboriginal\\r\\nwhalemen, the Red-Men, first sally out in canoes to give chase to the\\r\\nLeviathan?  And where but from Nantucket, too, did that first\\r\\nadventurous little sloop put forth, partly laden with imported\\r\\ncobblestones--so goes the story--to throw at the whales, in order to\\r\\ndiscover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the\\r\\nbowsprit?\\r\\n\\r\\nNow having a night, a day, and still another night following before\\r\\nme in New Bedford, ere I could embark for my destined port, it\\r\\nbecame a matter of concernment where I was to eat and sleep\\r\\nmeanwhile.  It was a very dubious-looking, nay, a very dark and\\r\\ndismal night, bitingly cold and cheerless.  I knew no one in the\\r\\nplace.  With anxious grapnels I had sounded my pocket, and only\\r\\nbrought up a few pieces of silver,--So, wherever you go, Ishmael,\\r\\nsaid I to myself, as I stood in the middle of a dreary street\\r\\nshouldering my bag, and comparing the gloom towards the north with\\r\\nthe darkness towards the south--wherever in your wisdom you may\\r\\nconclude to lodge for the night, my dear Ishmael, be sure to inquire\\r\\nthe price, and don\\'t be too particular.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith halting steps I paced the streets, and passed the sign of \"The\\r\\nCrossed Harpoons\"--but it looked too expensive and jolly there.\\r\\nFurther on, from the bright red windows of the \"Sword-Fish Inn,\"\\r\\nthere came such fervent rays, that it seemed to have melted the\\r\\npacked snow and ice from before the house, for everywhere else the\\r\\ncongealed frost lay ten inches thick in a hard, asphaltic\\r\\npavement,--rather weary for me, when I struck my foot against the\\r\\nflinty projections, because from hard, remorseless service the soles\\r\\nof my boots were in a most miserable plight.  Too expensive and\\r\\njolly, again thought I, pausing one moment to watch the broad glare\\r\\nin the street, and hear the sounds of the tinkling glasses within.\\r\\nBut go on, Ishmael, said I at last; don\\'t you hear? get away from\\r\\nbefore the door; your patched boots are stopping the way.  So on I\\r\\nwent.  I now by instinct followed the streets that took me waterward,\\r\\nfor there, doubtless, were the cheapest, if not the cheeriest inns.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch dreary streets! blocks of blackness, not houses, on either\\r\\nhand, and here and there a candle, like a candle moving about in a\\r\\ntomb.  At this hour of the night, of the last day of the week, that\\r\\nquarter of the town proved all but deserted.  But presently I came to\\r\\na smoky light proceeding from a low, wide building, the door of which\\r\\nstood invitingly open.  It had a careless look, as if it were meant\\r\\nfor the uses of the public; so, entering, the first thing I did was\\r\\nto stumble over an ash-box in the porch.  Ha! thought I, ha, as the\\r\\nflying particles almost choked me, are these ashes from that\\r\\ndestroyed city, Gomorrah?  But \"The Crossed Harpoons,\" and \"The\\r\\nSword-Fish?\"--this, then must needs be the sign of \"The Trap.\"\\r\\nHowever, I picked myself up and hearing a loud voice within, pushed\\r\\non and opened a second, interior door.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt seemed the great Black Parliament sitting in Tophet.  A hundred\\r\\nblack faces turned round in their rows to peer; and beyond, a black\\r\\nAngel of Doom was beating a book in a pulpit.  It was a negro church;\\r\\nand the preacher\\'s text was about the blackness of darkness, and the\\r\\nweeping and wailing and teeth-gnashing there.  Ha, Ishmael, muttered\\r\\nI, backing out, Wretched entertainment at the sign of \\'The Trap!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\nMoving on, I at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the\\r\\ndocks, and heard a forlorn creaking in the air; and looking up, saw a\\r\\nswinging sign over the door with a white painting upon it, faintly\\r\\nrepresenting a tall straight jet of misty spray, and these words\\r\\nunderneath--\"The Spouter Inn:--Peter Coffin.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nCoffin?--Spouter?--Rather ominous in that particular connexion,\\r\\nthought I.  But it is a common name in Nantucket, they say, and I\\r\\nsuppose this Peter here is an emigrant from there.  As the light\\r\\nlooked so dim, and the place, for the time, looked quiet enough, and\\r\\nthe dilapidated little wooden house itself looked as if it might have\\r\\nbeen carted here from the ruins of some burnt district, and as the\\r\\nswinging sign had a poverty-stricken sort of creak to it, I thought\\r\\nthat here was the very spot for cheap lodgings, and the best of pea\\r\\ncoffee.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a queer sort of place--a gable-ended old house, one side\\r\\npalsied as it were, and leaning over sadly.  It stood on a sharp\\r\\nbleak corner, where that tempestuous wind Euroclydon kept up a worse\\r\\nhowling than ever it did about poor Paul\\'s tossed craft.  Euroclydon,\\r\\nnevertheless, is a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one in-doors, with\\r\\nhis feet on the hob quietly toasting for bed.  \"In judging of that\\r\\ntempestuous wind called Euroclydon,\" says an old writer--of whose\\r\\nworks I possess the only copy extant--\"it maketh a marvellous\\r\\ndifference, whether thou lookest out at it from a glass window where\\r\\nthe frost is all on the outside, or whether thou observest it from\\r\\nthat sashless window, where the frost is on both sides, and of which\\r\\nthe wight Death is the only glazier.\"  True enough, thought I, as\\r\\nthis passage occurred to my mind--old black-letter, thou reasonest\\r\\nwell.  Yes, these eyes are windows, and this body of mine is the\\r\\nhouse.  What a pity they didn\\'t stop up the chinks and the crannies\\r\\nthough, and thrust in a little lint here and there.  But it\\'s too\\r\\nlate to make any improvements now.  The universe is finished; the\\r\\ncopestone is on, and the chips were carted off a million years ago.\\r\\nPoor Lazarus there, chattering his teeth against the curbstone for\\r\\nhis pillow, and shaking off his tatters with his shiverings, he might\\r\\nplug up both ears with rags, and put a corn-cob into his mouth, and\\r\\nyet that would not keep out the tempestuous Euroclydon.  Euroclydon!\\r\\nsays old Dives, in his red silken wrapper--(he had a redder one\\r\\nafterwards) pooh, pooh!  What a fine frosty night; how Orion\\r\\nglitters; what northern lights!  Let them talk of their oriental\\r\\nsummer climes of everlasting conservatories; give me the privilege of\\r\\nmaking my own summer with my own coals.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut what thinks Lazarus?  Can he warm his blue hands by holding them\\r\\nup to the grand northern lights?  Would not Lazarus rather be in\\r\\nSumatra than here?  Would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise\\r\\nalong the line of the equator; yea, ye gods! go down to the fiery pit\\r\\nitself, in order to keep out this frost?\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, that Lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone before\\r\\nthe door of Dives, this is more wonderful than that an iceberg should\\r\\nbe moored to one of the Moluccas.  Yet Dives himself, he too lives\\r\\nlike a Czar in an ice palace made of frozen sighs, and being a\\r\\npresident of a temperance society, he only drinks the tepid tears of\\r\\norphans.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut no more of this blubbering now, we are going a-whaling, and there\\r\\nis plenty of that yet to come.  Let us scrape the ice from our\\r\\nfrosted feet, and see what sort of a place this \"Spouter\" may be.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 3\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Spouter-Inn.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEntering that gable-ended Spouter-Inn, you found yourself in a wide,\\r\\nlow, straggling entry with old-fashioned wainscots, reminding one of\\r\\nthe bulwarks of some condemned old craft.  On one side hung a very\\r\\nlarge oilpainting so thoroughly besmoked, and every way defaced,\\r\\nthat in the unequal crosslights by which you viewed it, it was only\\r\\nby diligent study and a series of systematic visits to it, and\\r\\ncareful inquiry of the neighbors, that you could any way arrive at an\\r\\nunderstanding of its purpose.  Such unaccountable masses of shades\\r\\nand shadows, that at first you almost thought some ambitious young\\r\\nartist, in the time of the New England hags, had endeavored to\\r\\ndelineate chaos bewitched.  But by dint of much and earnest\\r\\ncontemplation, and oft repeated ponderings, and especially by\\r\\nthrowing open the little window towards the back of the entry, you at\\r\\nlast come to the conclusion that such an idea, however wild, might\\r\\nnot be altogether unwarranted.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut what most puzzled and confounded you was a long, limber,\\r\\nportentous, black mass of something hovering in the centre of the\\r\\npicture over three blue, dim, perpendicular lines floating in a\\r\\nnameless yeast.  A boggy, soggy, squitchy picture truly, enough to\\r\\ndrive a nervous man distracted.  Yet was there a sort of indefinite,\\r\\nhalf-attained, unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze you\\r\\nto it, till you involuntarily took an oath with yourself to find out\\r\\nwhat that marvellous painting meant.  Ever and anon a bright, but,\\r\\nalas, deceptive idea would dart you through.--It\\'s the Black Sea in a\\r\\nmidnight gale.--It\\'s the unnatural combat of the four primal\\r\\nelements.--It\\'s a blasted heath.--It\\'s a Hyperborean winter\\r\\nscene.--It\\'s the breaking-up of the icebound stream of Time.  But at\\r\\nlast all these fancies yielded to that one portentous something in\\r\\nthe picture\\'s midst.  THAT once found out, and all the rest were\\r\\nplain.  But stop; does it not bear a faint resemblance to a gigantic\\r\\nfish? even the great leviathan himself?\\r\\n\\r\\nIn fact, the artist\\'s design seemed this: a final theory of my own,\\r\\npartly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with\\r\\nwhom I conversed upon the subject.  The picture represents a\\r\\nCape-Horner in a great hurricane; the half-foundered ship weltering\\r\\nthere with its three dismantled masts alone visible; and an\\r\\nexasperated whale, purposing to spring clean over the craft, is in\\r\\nthe enormous act of impaling himself upon the three mast-heads.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish\\r\\narray of monstrous clubs and spears.  Some were thickly set with\\r\\nglittering teeth resembling ivory saws; others were tufted with knots\\r\\nof human hair; and one was sickle-shaped, with a vast handle sweeping\\r\\nround like the segment made in the new-mown grass by a long-armed\\r\\nmower.  You shuddered as you gazed, and wondered what monstrous\\r\\ncannibal and savage could ever have gone a death-harvesting with such\\r\\na hacking, horrifying implement.  Mixed with these were rusty old\\r\\nwhaling lances and harpoons all broken and deformed.  Some were\\r\\nstoried weapons.  With this once long lance, now wildly elbowed,\\r\\nfifty years ago did Nathan Swain kill fifteen whales between a\\r\\nsunrise and a sunset.  And that harpoon--so like a corkscrew now--was\\r\\nflung in Javan seas, and run away with by a whale, years afterwards\\r\\nslain off the Cape of Blanco.  The original iron entered nigh the\\r\\ntail, and, like a restless needle sojourning in the body of a man,\\r\\ntravelled full forty feet, and at last was found imbedded in the\\r\\nhump.\\r\\n\\r\\nCrossing this dusky entry, and on through yon low-arched way--cut\\r\\nthrough what in old times must have been a great central chimney with\\r\\nfireplaces all round--you enter the public room.  A still duskier\\r\\nplace is this, with such low ponderous beams above, and such old\\r\\nwrinkled planks beneath, that you would almost fancy you trod some\\r\\nold craft\\'s cockpits, especially of such a howling night, when this\\r\\ncorner-anchored old ark rocked so furiously.  On one side stood a\\r\\nlong, low, shelf-like table covered with cracked glass cases, filled\\r\\nwith dusty rarities gathered from this wide world\\'s remotest nooks.\\r\\nProjecting from the further angle of the room stands a dark-looking\\r\\nden--the bar--a rude attempt at a right whale\\'s head.  Be that how it\\r\\nmay, there stands the vast arched bone of the whale\\'s jaw, so wide, a\\r\\ncoach might almost drive beneath it.  Within are shabby shelves,\\r\\nranged round with old decanters, bottles, flasks; and in those jaws\\r\\nof swift destruction, like another cursed Jonah (by which name indeed\\r\\nthey called him), bustles a little withered old man, who, for their\\r\\nmoney, dearly sells the sailors deliriums and death.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison.  Though\\r\\ntrue cylinders without--within, the villanous green goggling glasses\\r\\ndeceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom.  Parallel\\r\\nmeridians rudely pecked into the glass, surround these footpads\\'\\r\\ngoblets.  Fill to THIS mark, and your charge is but a penny; to THIS\\r\\na penny more; and so on to the full glass--the Cape Horn measure,\\r\\nwhich you may gulp down for a shilling.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon entering the place I found a number of young seamen gathered\\r\\nabout a table, examining by a dim light divers specimens of\\r\\nSKRIMSHANDER.  I sought the landlord, and telling him I desired to be\\r\\naccommodated with a room, received for answer that his house was\\r\\nfull--not a bed unoccupied.  \"But avast,\" he added, tapping his\\r\\nforehead, \"you haint no objections to sharing a harpooneer\\'s blanket,\\r\\nhave ye?  I s\\'pose you are goin\\' a-whalin\\', so you\\'d better get used\\r\\nto that sort of thing.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI told him that I never liked to sleep two in a bed; that if I should\\r\\never do so, it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be, and\\r\\nthat if he (the landlord) really had no other place for me, and the\\r\\nharpooneer was not decidedly objectionable, why rather than wander\\r\\nfurther about a strange town on so bitter a night, I would put up\\r\\nwith the half of any decent man\\'s blanket.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I thought so.  All right; take a seat.  Supper?--you want supper?\\r\\nSupper\\'ll be ready directly.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI sat down on an old wooden settle, carved all over like a bench on\\r\\nthe Battery.  At one end a ruminating tar was still further adorning\\r\\nit with his jack-knife, stooping over and diligently working away at\\r\\nthe space between his legs.  He was trying his hand at a ship under\\r\\nfull sail, but he didn\\'t make much headway, I thought.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an\\r\\nadjoining room.  It was cold as Iceland--no fire at all--the landlord\\r\\nsaid he couldn\\'t afford it.  Nothing but two dismal tallow candles,\\r\\neach in a winding sheet.  We were fain to button up our monkey\\r\\njackets, and hold to our lips cups of scalding tea with our half\\r\\nfrozen fingers.  But the fare was of the most substantial kind--not\\r\\nonly meat and potatoes, but dumplings; good heavens! dumplings for\\r\\nsupper!  One young fellow in a green box coat, addressed himself to\\r\\nthese dumplings in a most direful manner.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My boy,\" said the landlord, \"you\\'ll have the nightmare to a dead\\r\\nsartainty.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Landlord,\" I whispered, \"that aint the harpooneer is it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh, no,\" said he, looking a sort of diabolically funny, \"the\\r\\nharpooneer is a dark complexioned chap.  He never eats dumplings, he\\r\\ndon\\'t--he eats nothing but steaks, and he likes \\'em rare.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The devil he does,\" says I.  \"Where is that harpooneer?  Is he\\r\\nhere?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He\\'ll be here afore long,\" was the answer.\\r\\n\\r\\nI could not help it, but I began to feel suspicious of this \"dark\\r\\ncomplexioned\" harpooneer.  At any rate, I made up my mind that if it\\r\\nso turned out that we should sleep together, he must undress and get\\r\\ninto bed before I did.\\r\\n\\r\\nSupper over, the company went back to the bar-room, when, knowing not\\r\\nwhat else to do with myself, I resolved to spend the rest of the\\r\\nevening as a looker on.\\r\\n\\r\\nPresently a rioting noise was heard without.  Starting up, the\\r\\nlandlord cried, \"That\\'s the Grampus\\'s crew.  I seed her reported in\\r\\nthe offing this morning; a three years\\' voyage, and a full ship.\\r\\nHurrah, boys; now we\\'ll have the latest news from the Feegees.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nA tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry; the door was flung\\r\\nopen, and in rolled a wild set of mariners enough.  Enveloped in\\r\\ntheir shaggy watch coats, and with their heads muffled in woollen\\r\\ncomforters, all bedarned and ragged, and their beards stiff with\\r\\nicicles, they seemed an eruption of bears from Labrador.  They had\\r\\njust landed from their boat, and this was the first house they\\r\\nentered.  No wonder, then, that they made a straight wake for the\\r\\nwhale\\'s mouth--the bar--when the wrinkled little old Jonah, there\\r\\nofficiating, soon poured them out brimmers all round.  One complained\\r\\nof a bad cold in his head, upon which Jonah mixed him a pitch-like\\r\\npotion of gin and molasses, which he swore was a sovereign cure for\\r\\nall colds and catarrhs whatsoever, never mind of how long standing,\\r\\nor whether caught off the coast of Labrador, or on the weather side\\r\\nof an ice-island.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe liquor soon mounted into their heads, as it generally does even\\r\\nwith the arrantest topers newly landed from sea, and they began\\r\\ncapering about most obstreperously.\\r\\n\\r\\nI observed, however, that one of them held somewhat aloof, and though\\r\\nhe seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his\\r\\nown sober face, yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much\\r\\nnoise as the rest.  This man interested me at once; and since the\\r\\nsea-gods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate (though\\r\\nbut a sleeping-partner one, so far as this narrative is concerned),\\r\\nI will here venture upon a little description of him.  He stood full\\r\\nsix feet in height, with noble shoulders, and a chest like a\\r\\ncoffer-dam.  I have seldom seen such brawn in a man.  His face was\\r\\ndeeply brown and burnt, making his white teeth dazzling by the\\r\\ncontrast; while in the deep shadows of his eyes floated some\\r\\nreminiscences that did not seem to give him much joy.  His voice at\\r\\nonce announced that he was a Southerner, and from his fine stature, I\\r\\nthought he must be one of those tall mountaineers from the\\r\\nAlleghanian Ridge in Virginia.  When the revelry of his companions\\r\\nhad mounted to its height, this man slipped away unobserved, and I\\r\\nsaw no more of him till he became my comrade on the sea.  In a few\\r\\nminutes, however, he was missed by his shipmates, and being, it\\r\\nseems, for some reason a huge favourite with them, they raised a cry\\r\\nof \"Bulkington!  Bulkington! where\\'s Bulkington?\" and darted out of\\r\\nthe house in pursuit of him.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was now about nine o\\'clock, and the room seeming almost\\r\\nsupernaturally quiet after these orgies, I began to congratulate\\r\\nmyself upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to\\r\\nthe entrance of the seamen.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo man prefers to sleep two in a bed.  In fact, you would a good deal\\r\\nrather not sleep with your own brother.  I don\\'t know how it is, but\\r\\npeople like to be private when they are sleeping.  And when it comes\\r\\nto sleeping with an unknown stranger, in a strange inn, in a strange\\r\\ntown, and that stranger a harpooneer, then your objections\\r\\nindefinitely multiply.  Nor was there any earthly reason why I as a\\r\\nsailor should sleep two in a bed, more than anybody else; for sailors\\r\\nno more sleep two in a bed at sea, than bachelor Kings do ashore.  To\\r\\nbe sure they all sleep together in one apartment, but you have your\\r\\nown hammock, and cover yourself with your own blanket, and sleep in\\r\\nyour own skin.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe more I pondered over this harpooneer, the more I abominated the\\r\\nthought of sleeping with him.  It was fair to presume that being a\\r\\nharpooneer, his linen or woollen, as the case might be, would not be\\r\\nof the tidiest, certainly none of the finest.  I began to twitch all\\r\\nover.  Besides, it was getting late, and my decent harpooneer ought\\r\\nto be home and going bedwards.  Suppose now, he should tumble in upon\\r\\nme at midnight--how could I tell from what vile hole he had been\\r\\ncoming?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Landlord!  I\\'ve changed my mind about that harpooneer.--I shan\\'t\\r\\nsleep with him.  I\\'ll try the bench here.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Just as you please; I\\'m sorry I cant spare ye a tablecloth for a\\r\\nmattress, and it\\'s a plaguy rough board here\"--feeling of the knots\\r\\nand notches.  \"But wait a bit, Skrimshander; I\\'ve got a carpenter\\'s\\r\\nplane there in the bar--wait, I say, and I\\'ll make ye snug enough.\"\\r\\nSo saying he procured the plane; and with his old silk handkerchief\\r\\nfirst dusting the bench, vigorously set to planing away at my bed,\\r\\nthe while grinning like an ape.  The shavings flew right and left;\\r\\ntill at last the plane-iron came bump against an indestructible knot.\\r\\nThe landlord was near spraining his wrist, and I told him for\\r\\nheaven\\'s sake to quit--the bed was soft enough to suit me, and I did\\r\\nnot know how all the planing in the world could make eider down of a\\r\\npine plank.  So gathering up the shavings with another grin, and\\r\\nthrowing them into the great stove in the middle of the room, he went\\r\\nabout his business, and left me in a brown study.\\r\\n\\r\\nI now took the measure of the bench, and found that it was a foot too\\r\\nshort; but that could be mended with a chair.  But it was a foot too\\r\\nnarrow, and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher\\r\\nthan the planed one--so there was no yoking them.  I then placed the\\r\\nfirst bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall,\\r\\nleaving a little interval between, for my back to settle down in.\\r\\nBut I soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me\\r\\nfrom under the sill of the window, that this plan would never do at\\r\\nall, especially as another current from the rickety door met the one\\r\\nfrom the window, and both together formed a series of small\\r\\nwhirlwinds in the immediate vicinity of the spot where I had thought\\r\\nto spend the night.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe devil fetch that harpooneer, thought I, but stop, couldn\\'t I\\r\\nsteal a march on him--bolt his door inside, and jump into his bed,\\r\\nnot to be wakened by the most violent knockings?  It seemed no bad\\r\\nidea; but upon second thoughts I dismissed it.  For who could tell\\r\\nbut what the next morning, so soon as I popped out of the room, the\\r\\nharpooneer might be standing in the entry, all ready to knock me\\r\\ndown!\\r\\n\\r\\nStill, looking round me again, and seeing no possible chance of\\r\\nspending a sufferable night unless in some other person\\'s bed, I\\r\\nbegan to think that after all I might be cherishing unwarrantable\\r\\nprejudices against this unknown harpooneer.  Thinks I, I\\'ll wait\\r\\nawhile; he must be dropping in before long.  I\\'ll have a good look at\\r\\nhim then, and perhaps we may become jolly good bedfellows after\\r\\nall--there\\'s no telling.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut though the other boarders kept coming in by ones, twos, and\\r\\nthrees, and going to bed, yet no sign of my harpooneer.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Landlord! said I, \"what sort of a chap is he--does he always keep\\r\\nsuch late hours?\"  It was now hard upon twelve o\\'clock.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle, and seemed to be\\r\\nmightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension.  \"No,\" he\\r\\nanswered, \"generally he\\'s an early bird--airley to bed and airley to\\r\\nrise--yes, he\\'s the bird what catches the worm.  But to-night he\\r\\nwent out a peddling, you see, and I don\\'t see what on airth keeps him\\r\\nso late, unless, may be, he can\\'t sell his head.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Can\\'t sell his head?--What sort of a bamboozingly story is this you\\r\\nare telling me?\" getting into a towering rage.  \"Do you pretend to\\r\\nsay, landlord, that this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessed\\r\\nSaturday night, or rather Sunday morning, in peddling his head around\\r\\nthis town?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"That\\'s precisely it,\" said the landlord, \"and I told him he couldn\\'t\\r\\nsell it here, the market\\'s overstocked.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With what?\" shouted I.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With heads to be sure; ain\\'t there too many heads in the world?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I tell you what it is, landlord,\" said I quite calmly, \"you\\'d better\\r\\nstop spinning that yarn to me--I\\'m not green.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"May be not,\" taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick, \"but I\\r\\nrayther guess you\\'ll be done BROWN if that ere harpooneer hears you a\\r\\nslanderin\\' his head.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I\\'ll break it for him,\" said I, now flying into a passion again at\\r\\nthis unaccountable farrago of the landlord\\'s.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"It\\'s broke a\\'ready,\" said he.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Broke,\" said I--\"BROKE, do you mean?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sartain, and that\\'s the very reason he can\\'t sell it, I guess.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Landlord,\" said I, going up to him as cool as Mt. Hecla in a\\r\\nsnow-storm--\"landlord, stop whittling.  You and I must understand one\\r\\nanother, and that too without delay.  I come to your house and want a\\r\\nbed; you tell me you can only give me half a one; that the other half\\r\\nbelongs to a certain harpooneer.  And about this harpooneer, whom I\\r\\nhave not yet seen, you persist in telling me the most mystifying and\\r\\nexasperating stories tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling\\r\\ntowards the man whom you design for my bedfellow--a sort of\\r\\nconnexion, landlord, which is an intimate and confidential one in the\\r\\nhighest degree.  I now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and\\r\\nwhat this harpooneer is, and whether I shall be in all respects safe\\r\\nto spend the night with him.  And in the first place, you will be so\\r\\ngood as to unsay that story about selling his head, which if true I\\r\\ntake to be good evidence that this harpooneer is stark mad, and I\\'ve\\r\\nno idea of sleeping with a madman; and you, sir, YOU I mean,\\r\\nlandlord, YOU, sir, by trying to induce me to do so knowingly, would\\r\\nthereby render yourself liable to a criminal prosecution.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wall,\" said the landlord, fetching a long breath, \"that\\'s a purty\\r\\nlong sarmon for a chap that rips a little now and then.  But be easy,\\r\\nbe easy, this here harpooneer I have been tellin\\' you of has just\\r\\narrived from the south seas, where he bought up a lot of \\'balmed New\\r\\nZealand heads (great curios, you know), and he\\'s sold all on \\'em but\\r\\none, and that one he\\'s trying to sell to-night, cause to-morrow\\'s\\r\\nSunday, and it would not do to be sellin\\' human heads about the\\r\\nstreets when folks is goin\\' to churches.  He wanted to, last Sunday,\\r\\nbut I stopped him just as he was goin\\' out of the door with four\\r\\nheads strung on a string, for all the airth like a string of inions.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery, and\\r\\nshowed that the landlord, after all, had had no idea of fooling\\r\\nme--but at the same time what could I think of a harpooneer who\\r\\nstayed out of a Saturday night clean into the holy Sabbath, engaged\\r\\nin such a cannibal business as selling the heads of dead idolators?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Depend upon it, landlord, that harpooneer is a dangerous man.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He pays reg\\'lar,\" was the rejoinder.  \"But come, it\\'s getting\\r\\ndreadful late, you had better be turning flukes--it\\'s a nice bed;\\r\\nSal and me slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced.  There\\'s\\r\\nplenty of room for two to kick about in that bed; it\\'s an almighty\\r\\nbig bed that.  Why, afore we give it up, Sal used to put our Sam and\\r\\nlittle Johnny in the foot of it.  But I got a dreaming and sprawling\\r\\nabout one night, and somehow, Sam got pitched on the floor, and came\\r\\nnear breaking his arm.  Arter that, Sal said it wouldn\\'t do.  Come\\r\\nalong here, I\\'ll give ye a glim in a jiffy;\" and so saying he lighted\\r\\na candle and held it towards me, offering to lead the way.  But I\\r\\nstood irresolute; when looking at a clock in the corner, he exclaimed\\r\\n\"I vum it\\'s Sunday--you won\\'t see that harpooneer to-night; he\\'s come\\r\\nto anchor somewhere--come along then; DO come; WON\\'T ye come?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI considered the matter a moment, and then up stairs we went, and I\\r\\nwas ushered into a small room, cold as a clam, and furnished, sure\\r\\nenough, with a prodigious bed, almost big enough indeed for any four\\r\\nharpooneers to sleep abreast.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"There,\" said the landlord, placing the candle on a crazy old sea\\r\\nchest that did double duty as a wash-stand and centre table; \"there,\\r\\nmake yourself comfortable now, and good night to ye.\"  I turned\\r\\nround from eyeing the bed, but he had disappeared.\\r\\n\\r\\nFolding back the counterpane, I stooped over the bed.  Though none of\\r\\nthe most elegant, it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well.  I then\\r\\nglanced round the room; and besides the bedstead and centre table,\\r\\ncould see no other furniture belonging to the place, but a rude\\r\\nshelf, the four walls, and a papered fireboard representing a man\\r\\nstriking a whale.  Of things not properly belonging to the room,\\r\\nthere was a hammock lashed up, and thrown upon the floor in one\\r\\ncorner; also a large seaman\\'s bag, containing the harpooneer\\'s\\r\\nwardrobe, no doubt in lieu of a land trunk.  Likewise, there was a\\r\\nparcel of outlandish bone fish hooks on the shelf over the\\r\\nfire-place, and a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut what is this on the chest?  I took it up, and held it close to\\r\\nthe light, and felt it, and smelt it, and tried every way possible to\\r\\narrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it.  I can compare\\r\\nit to nothing but a large door mat, ornamented at the edges with\\r\\nlittle tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills\\r\\nround an Indian moccasin.  There was a hole or slit in the middle of\\r\\nthis mat, as you see the same in South American ponchos.  But could\\r\\nit be possible that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat,\\r\\nand parade the streets of any Christian town in that sort of guise?\\r\\nI put it on, to try it, and it weighed me down like a hamper, being\\r\\nuncommonly shaggy and thick, and I thought a little damp, as though\\r\\nthis mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day.  I\\r\\nwent up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall, and I never\\r\\nsaw such a sight in my life.  I tore myself out of it in such a hurry\\r\\nthat I gave myself a kink in the neck.\\r\\n\\r\\nI sat down on the side of the bed, and commenced thinking about this\\r\\nhead-peddling harpooneer, and his door mat.  After thinking some time\\r\\non the bed-side, I got up and took off my monkey jacket, and then\\r\\nstood in the middle of the room thinking.  I then took off my coat,\\r\\nand thought a little more in my shirt sleeves.  But beginning to feel\\r\\nvery cold now, half undressed as I was, and remembering what the\\r\\nlandlord said about the harpooneer\\'s not coming home at all that\\r\\nnight, it being so very late, I made no more ado, but jumped out of\\r\\nmy pantaloons and boots, and then blowing out the light tumbled into\\r\\nbed, and commended myself to the care of heaven.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether that mattress was stuffed with corn-cobs or broken crockery,\\r\\nthere is no telling, but I rolled about a good deal, and could not\\r\\nsleep for a long time.  At last I slid off into a light doze, and had\\r\\npretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of Nod, when I\\r\\nheard a heavy footfall in the passage, and saw a glimmer of light\\r\\ncome into the room from under the door.\\r\\n\\r\\nLord save me, thinks I, that must be the harpooneer, the infernal\\r\\nhead-peddler.  But I lay perfectly still, and resolved not to say a\\r\\nword till spoken to.  Holding a light in one hand, and that identical\\r\\nNew Zealand head in the other, the stranger entered the room, and\\r\\nwithout looking towards the bed, placed his candle a good way off\\r\\nfrom me on the floor in one corner, and then began working away at\\r\\nthe knotted cords of the large bag I before spoke of as being in the\\r\\nroom.  I was all eagerness to see his face, but he kept it averted\\r\\nfor some time while employed in unlacing the bag\\'s mouth.  This\\r\\naccomplished, however, he turned round--when, good heavens! what a\\r\\nsight!  Such a face!  It was of a dark, purplish, yellow colour, here\\r\\nand there stuck over with large blackish looking squares.  Yes, it\\'s\\r\\njust as I thought, he\\'s a terrible bedfellow; he\\'s been in a fight,\\r\\ngot dreadfully cut, and here he is, just from the surgeon.  But at\\r\\nthat moment he chanced to turn his face so towards the light, that I\\r\\nplainly saw they could not be sticking-plasters at all, those black\\r\\nsquares on his cheeks.  They were stains of some sort or other.  At\\r\\nfirst I knew not what to make of this; but soon an inkling of the\\r\\ntruth occurred to me.  I remembered a story of a white man--a\\r\\nwhaleman too--who, falling among the cannibals, had been tattooed by\\r\\nthem.  I concluded that this harpooneer, in the course of his distant\\r\\nvoyages, must have met with a similar adventure.  And what is it,\\r\\nthought I, after all!  It\\'s only his outside; a man can be honest in\\r\\nany sort of skin.  But then, what to make of his unearthly\\r\\ncomplexion, that part of it, I mean, lying round about, and\\r\\ncompletely independent of the squares of tattooing.  To be sure, it\\r\\nmight be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning; but I never\\r\\nheard of a hot sun\\'s tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one.\\r\\nHowever, I had never been in the South Seas; and perhaps the sun\\r\\nthere produced these extraordinary effects upon the skin.  Now, while\\r\\nall these ideas were passing through me like lightning, this\\r\\nharpooneer never noticed me at all.  But, after some difficulty\\r\\nhaving opened his bag, he commenced fumbling in it, and presently\\r\\npulled out a sort of tomahawk, and a seal-skin wallet with the hair\\r\\non.  Placing these on the old chest in the middle of the room, he\\r\\nthen took the New Zealand head--a ghastly thing enough--and crammed\\r\\nit down into the bag.  He now took off his hat--a new beaver\\r\\nhat--when I came nigh singing out with fresh surprise.  There was no\\r\\nhair on his head--none to speak of at least--nothing but a small\\r\\nscalp-knot twisted up on his forehead.  His bald purplish head now\\r\\nlooked for all the world like a mildewed skull.  Had not the stranger\\r\\nstood between me and the door, I would have bolted out of it quicker\\r\\nthan ever I bolted a dinner.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven as it was, I thought something of slipping out of the window,\\r\\nbut it was the second floor back.  I am no coward, but what to make\\r\\nof this head-peddling purple rascal altogether passed my\\r\\ncomprehension.  Ignorance is the parent of fear, and being completely\\r\\nnonplussed and confounded about the stranger, I confess I was now as\\r\\nmuch afraid of him as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken\\r\\ninto my room at the dead of night.  In fact, I was so afraid of him\\r\\nthat I was not game enough just then to address him, and demand a\\r\\nsatisfactory answer concerning what seemed inexplicable in him.\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, he continued the business of undressing, and at last\\r\\nshowed his chest and arms.  As I live, these covered parts of him\\r\\nwere checkered with the same squares as his face; his back, too, was\\r\\nall over the same dark squares; he seemed to have been in a Thirty\\r\\nYears\\' War, and just escaped from it with a sticking-plaster shirt.\\r\\nStill more, his very legs were marked, as if a parcel of dark green\\r\\nfrogs were running up the trunks of young palms.  It was now quite\\r\\nplain that he must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard\\r\\nof a whaleman in the South Seas, and so landed in this Christian\\r\\ncountry.  I quaked to think of it.  A peddler of heads too--perhaps\\r\\nthe heads of his own brothers.  He might take a fancy to\\r\\nmine--heavens! look at that tomahawk!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut there was no time for shuddering, for now the savage went about\\r\\nsomething that completely fascinated my attention, and convinced me\\r\\nthat he must indeed be a heathen.  Going to his heavy grego, or\\r\\nwrapall, or dreadnaught, which he had previously hung on a chair, he\\r\\nfumbled in the pockets, and produced at length a curious little\\r\\ndeformed image with a hunch on its back, and exactly the colour of a\\r\\nthree days\\' old Congo baby.  Remembering the embalmed head, at first\\r\\nI almost thought that this black manikin was a real baby preserved\\r\\nin some similar manner.  But seeing that it was not at all limber,\\r\\nand that it glistened a good deal like polished ebony, I concluded\\r\\nthat it must be nothing but a wooden idol, which indeed it proved to\\r\\nbe.  For now the savage goes up to the empty fire-place, and removing\\r\\nthe papered fire-board, sets up this little hunch-backed image, like\\r\\na tenpin, between the andirons.  The chimney jambs and all the bricks\\r\\ninside were very sooty, so that I thought this fire-place made a very\\r\\nappropriate little shrine or chapel for his Congo idol.\\r\\n\\r\\nI now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image, feeling but\\r\\nill at ease meantime--to see what was next to follow.  First he takes\\r\\nabout a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket, and\\r\\nplaces them carefully before the idol; then laying a bit of ship\\r\\nbiscuit on top and applying the flame from the lamp, he kindled the\\r\\nshavings into a sacrificial blaze.  Presently, after many hasty\\r\\nsnatches into the fire, and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers\\r\\n(whereby he seemed to be scorching them badly), he at last succeeded\\r\\nin drawing out the biscuit; then blowing off the heat and ashes a\\r\\nlittle, he made a polite offer of it to the little negro.  But the\\r\\nlittle devil did not seem to fancy such dry sort of fare at all; he\\r\\nnever moved his lips.  All these strange antics were accompanied by\\r\\nstill stranger guttural noises from the devotee, who seemed to be\\r\\npraying in a sing-song or else singing some pagan psalmody or other,\\r\\nduring which his face twitched about in the most unnatural manner.\\r\\nAt last extinguishing the fire, he took the idol up very\\r\\nunceremoniously, and bagged it again in his grego pocket as\\r\\ncarelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness, and\\r\\nseeing him now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business\\r\\noperations, and jumping into bed with me, I thought it was high time,\\r\\nnow or never, before the light was put out, to break the spell in\\r\\nwhich I had so long been bound.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the interval I spent in deliberating what to say, was a fatal\\r\\none.  Taking up his tomahawk from the table, he examined the head of\\r\\nit for an instant, and then holding it to the light, with his mouth\\r\\nat the handle, he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke.  The next\\r\\nmoment the light was extinguished, and this wild cannibal, tomahawk\\r\\nbetween his teeth, sprang into bed with me.  I sang out, I could not\\r\\nhelp it now; and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began\\r\\nfeeling me.\\r\\n\\r\\nStammering out something, I knew not what, I rolled away from him\\r\\nagainst the wall, and then conjured him, whoever or whatever he might\\r\\nbe, to keep quiet, and let me get up and light the lamp again.  But\\r\\nhis guttural responses satisfied me at once that he but ill\\r\\ncomprehended my meaning.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who-e debel you?\"--he at last said--\"you no speak-e, dam-me, I\\r\\nkill-e.\"  And so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about\\r\\nme in the dark.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Landlord, for God\\'s sake, Peter Coffin!\" shouted I.  \"Landlord!\\r\\nWatch!  Coffin!  Angels! save me!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Speak-e! tell-ee me who-ee be, or dam-me, I kill-e!\" again growled\\r\\nthe cannibal, while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered\\r\\nthe hot tobacco ashes about me till I thought my linen would get on\\r\\nfire.  But thank heaven, at that moment the landlord came into the\\r\\nroom light in hand, and leaping from the bed I ran up to him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Don\\'t be afraid now,\" said he, grinning again, \"Queequeg here\\r\\nwouldn\\'t harm a hair of your head.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Stop your grinning,\" shouted I, \"and why didn\\'t you tell me that\\r\\nthat infernal harpooneer was a cannibal?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I thought ye know\\'d it;--didn\\'t I tell ye, he was a peddlin\\' heads\\r\\naround town?--but turn flukes again and go to sleep.  Queequeg, look\\r\\nhere--you sabbee me, I sabbee--you this man sleepe you--you sabbee?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Me sabbee plenty\"--grunted Queequeg, puffing away at his pipe and\\r\\nsitting up in bed.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"You gettee in,\" he added, motioning to me with his tomahawk, and\\r\\nthrowing the clothes to one side.  He really did this in not only a\\r\\ncivil but a really kind and charitable way.  I stood looking at him a\\r\\nmoment.  For all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean, comely\\r\\nlooking cannibal.  What\\'s all this fuss I have been making about,\\r\\nthought I to myself--the man\\'s a human being just as I am: he has\\r\\njust as much reason to fear me, as I have to be afraid of him.\\r\\nBetter sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken Christian.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Landlord,\" said I, \"tell him to stash his tomahawk there, or pipe,\\r\\nor whatever you call it; tell him to stop smoking, in short, and I\\r\\nwill turn in with him.  But I don\\'t fancy having a man smoking in bed\\r\\nwith me.  It\\'s dangerous.  Besides, I ain\\'t insured.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThis being told to Queequeg, he at once complied, and again politely\\r\\nmotioned me to get into bed--rolling over to one side as much as to\\r\\nsay--I won\\'t touch a leg of ye.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good night, landlord,\" said I, \"you may go.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI turned in, and never slept better in my life.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 4\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Counterpane.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon waking next morning about daylight, I found Queequeg\\'s arm\\r\\nthrown over me in the most loving and affectionate manner.  You had\\r\\nalmost thought I had been his wife.  The counterpane was of\\r\\npatchwork, full of odd little parti-coloured squares and triangles;\\r\\nand this arm of his tattooed all over with an interminable Cretan\\r\\nlabyrinth of a figure, no two parts of which were of one precise\\r\\nshade--owing I suppose to his keeping his arm at sea unmethodically\\r\\nin sun and shade, his shirt sleeves irregularly rolled up at various\\r\\ntimes--this same arm of his, I say, looked for all the world like a\\r\\nstrip of that same patchwork quilt.  Indeed, partly lying on it as\\r\\nthe arm did when I first awoke, I could hardly tell it from the\\r\\nquilt, they so blended their hues together; and it was only by the\\r\\nsense of weight and pressure that I could tell that Queequeg was\\r\\nhugging me.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy sensations were strange.  Let me try to explain them.  When I was\\r\\na child, I well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell\\r\\nme; whether it was a reality or a dream, I never could entirely\\r\\nsettle.  The circumstance was this.  I had been cutting up some caper\\r\\nor other--I think it was trying to crawl up the chimney, as I had\\r\\nseen a little sweep do a few days previous; and my stepmother who,\\r\\nsomehow or other, was all the time whipping me, or sending me to bed\\r\\nsupperless,--my mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and\\r\\npacked me off to bed, though it was only two o\\'clock in the afternoon\\r\\nof the 21st June, the longest day in the year in our hemisphere.  I\\r\\nfelt dreadfully.  But there was no help for it, so up stairs I went\\r\\nto my little room in the third floor, undressed myself as slowly as\\r\\npossible so as to kill time, and with a bitter sigh got between the\\r\\nsheets.\\r\\n\\r\\nI lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must\\r\\nelapse before I could hope for a resurrection.  Sixteen hours in bed!\\r\\nthe small of my back ached to think of it.  And it was so light too;\\r\\nthe sun shining in at the window, and a great rattling of coaches in\\r\\nthe streets, and the sound of gay voices all over the house.  I felt\\r\\nworse and worse--at last I got up, dressed, and softly going down in\\r\\nmy stockinged feet, sought out my stepmother, and suddenly threw\\r\\nmyself at her feet, beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a\\r\\ngood slippering for my misbehaviour; anything indeed but condemning\\r\\nme to lie abed such an unendurable length of time.  But she was the\\r\\nbest and most conscientious of stepmothers, and back I had to go to\\r\\nmy room.  For several hours I lay there broad awake, feeling a great\\r\\ndeal worse than I have ever done since, even from the greatest\\r\\nsubsequent misfortunes.  At last I must have fallen into a troubled\\r\\nnightmare of a doze; and slowly waking from it--half steeped in\\r\\ndreams--I opened my eyes, and the before sun-lit room was now wrapped\\r\\nin outer darkness.  Instantly I felt a shock running through all my\\r\\nframe; nothing was to be seen, and nothing was to be heard; but a\\r\\nsupernatural hand seemed placed in mine.  My arm hung over the\\r\\ncounterpane, and the nameless, unimaginable, silent form or phantom,\\r\\nto which the hand belonged, seemed closely seated by my bed-side.\\r\\nFor what seemed ages piled on ages, I lay there, frozen with the most\\r\\nawful fears, not daring to drag away my hand; yet ever thinking that\\r\\nif I could but stir it one single inch, the horrid spell would be\\r\\nbroken.  I knew not how this consciousness at last glided away from\\r\\nme; but waking in the morning, I shudderingly remembered it all, and\\r\\nfor days and weeks and months afterwards I lost myself in confounding\\r\\nattempts to explain the mystery.  Nay, to this very hour, I often\\r\\npuzzle myself with it.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, take away the awful fear, and my sensations at feeling the\\r\\nsupernatural hand in mine were very similar, in their strangeness,\\r\\nto those which I experienced on waking up and seeing Queequeg\\'s pagan\\r\\narm thrown round me.  But at length all the past night\\'s events\\r\\nsoberly recurred, one by one, in fixed reality, and then I lay only\\r\\nalive to the comical predicament.  For though I tried to move his\\r\\narm--unlock his bridegroom clasp--yet, sleeping as he was, he still\\r\\nhugged me tightly, as though naught but death should part us twain.\\r\\nI now strove to rouse him--\"Queequeg!\"--but his only answer was a\\r\\nsnore.  I then rolled over, my neck feeling as if it were in a\\r\\nhorse-collar; and suddenly felt a slight scratch.  Throwing aside the\\r\\ncounterpane, there lay the tomahawk sleeping by the savage\\'s side, as\\r\\nif it were a hatchet-faced baby.  A pretty pickle, truly, thought I;\\r\\nabed here in a strange house in the broad day, with a cannibal and a\\r\\ntomahawk!  \"Queequeg!--in the name of goodness, Queequeg, wake!\"  At\\r\\nlength, by dint of much wriggling, and loud and incessant\\r\\nexpostulations upon the unbecomingness of his hugging a fellow male\\r\\nin that matrimonial sort of style, I succeeded in extracting a grunt;\\r\\nand presently, he drew back his arm, shook himself all over like a\\r\\nNewfoundland dog just from the water, and sat up in bed, stiff as a\\r\\npike-staff, looking at me, and rubbing his eyes as if he did not\\r\\naltogether remember how I came to be there, though a dim\\r\\nconsciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning\\r\\nover him.  Meanwhile, I lay quietly eyeing him, having no serious\\r\\nmisgivings now, and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a\\r\\ncreature.  When, at last, his mind seemed made up touching the\\r\\ncharacter of his bedfellow, and he became, as it were, reconciled to\\r\\nthe fact; he jumped out upon the floor, and by certain signs and\\r\\nsounds gave me to understand that, if it pleased me, he would dress\\r\\nfirst and then leave me to dress afterwards, leaving the whole\\r\\napartment to myself.  Thinks I, Queequeg, under the circumstances,\\r\\nthis is a very civilized overture; but, the truth is, these savages\\r\\nhave an innate sense of delicacy, say what you will; it is marvellous\\r\\nhow essentially polite they are.  I pay this particular compliment to\\r\\nQueequeg, because he treated me with so much civility and\\r\\nconsideration, while I was guilty of great rudeness; staring at him\\r\\nfrom the bed, and watching all his toilette motions; for the time my\\r\\ncuriosity getting the better of my breeding.  Nevertheless, a man\\r\\nlike Queequeg you don\\'t see every day, he and his ways were well\\r\\nworth unusual regarding.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat, a very tall\\r\\none, by the by, and then--still minus his trowsers--he hunted up his\\r\\nboots.  What under the heavens he did it for, I cannot tell, but his\\r\\nnext movement was to crush himself--boots in hand, and hat on--under\\r\\nthe bed; when, from sundry violent gaspings and strainings, I\\r\\ninferred he was hard at work booting himself; though by no law of\\r\\npropriety that I ever heard of, is any man required to be private\\r\\nwhen putting on his boots.  But Queequeg, do you see, was a creature\\r\\nin the transition stage--neither caterpillar nor butterfly.  He was\\r\\njust enough civilized to show off his outlandishness in the strangest\\r\\npossible manners.  His education was not yet completed.  He was an\\r\\nundergraduate.  If he had not been a small degree civilized, he very\\r\\nprobably would not have troubled himself with boots at all; but then,\\r\\nif he had not been still a savage, he never would have dreamt of\\r\\ngetting under the bed to put them on.  At last, he emerged with his\\r\\nhat very much dented and crushed down over his eyes, and began\\r\\ncreaking and limping about the room, as if, not being much accustomed\\r\\nto boots, his pair of damp, wrinkled cowhide ones--probably not made\\r\\nto order either--rather pinched and tormented him at the first go off\\r\\nof a bitter cold morning.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeeing, now, that there were no curtains to the window, and that the\\r\\nstreet being very narrow, the house opposite commanded a plain view\\r\\ninto the room, and observing more and more the indecorous figure that\\r\\nQueequeg made, staving about with little else but his hat and boots\\r\\non; I begged him as well as I could, to accelerate his toilet\\r\\nsomewhat, and particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as\\r\\npossible.  He complied, and then proceeded to wash himself.  At that\\r\\ntime in the morning any Christian would have washed his face; but\\r\\nQueequeg, to my amazement, contented himself with restricting his\\r\\nablutions to his chest, arms, and hands.  He then donned his\\r\\nwaistcoat, and taking up a piece of hard soap on the wash-stand\\r\\ncentre table, dipped it into water and commenced lathering his face.\\r\\nI was watching to see where he kept his razor, when lo and behold, he\\r\\ntakes the harpoon from the bed corner, slips out the long wooden\\r\\nstock, unsheathes the head, whets it a little on his boot, and\\r\\nstriding up to the bit of mirror against the wall, begins a vigorous\\r\\nscraping, or rather harpooning of his cheeks.  Thinks I, Queequeg,\\r\\nthis is using Rogers\\'s best cutlery with a vengeance.  Afterwards I\\r\\nwondered the less at this operation when I came to know of what fine\\r\\nsteel the head of a harpoon is made, and how exceedingly sharp the\\r\\nlong straight edges are always kept.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe rest of his toilet was soon achieved, and he proudly marched out\\r\\nof the room, wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket, and\\r\\nsporting his harpoon like a marshal\\'s baton.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 5\\r\\n\\r\\nBreakfast.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI quickly followed suit, and descending into the bar-room accosted\\r\\nthe grinning landlord very pleasantly.  I cherished no malice towards\\r\\nhim, though he had been skylarking with me not a little in the matter\\r\\nof my bedfellow.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, a good laugh is a mighty good thing, and rather too scarce a\\r\\ngood thing; the more\\'s the pity.  So, if any one man, in his own\\r\\nproper person, afford stuff for a good joke to anybody, let him not\\r\\nbe backward, but let him cheerfully allow himself to spend and be\\r\\nspent in that way.  And the man that has anything bountifully\\r\\nlaughable about him, be sure there is more in that man than you\\r\\nperhaps think for.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe bar-room was now full of the boarders who had been dropping in\\r\\nthe night previous, and whom I had not as yet had a good look at.\\r\\nThey were nearly all whalemen; chief mates, and second mates, and\\r\\nthird mates, and sea carpenters, and sea coopers, and sea\\r\\nblacksmiths, and harpooneers, and ship keepers; a brown and brawny\\r\\ncompany, with bosky beards; an unshorn, shaggy set, all wearing\\r\\nmonkey jackets for morning gowns.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashore.\\r\\nThis young fellow\\'s healthy cheek is like a sun-toasted pear in hue,\\r\\nand would seem to smell almost as musky; he cannot have been three\\r\\ndays landed from his Indian voyage.  That man next him looks a few\\r\\nshades lighter; you might say a touch of satin wood is in him.  In\\r\\nthe complexion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn, but slightly\\r\\nbleached withal; HE doubtless has tarried whole weeks ashore.  But\\r\\nwho could show a cheek like Queequeg? which, barred with various\\r\\ntints, seemed like the Andes\\' western slope, to show forth in one\\r\\narray, contrasting climates, zone by zone.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Grub, ho!\" now cried the landlord, flinging open a door, and in we\\r\\nwent to breakfast.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey say that men who have seen the world, thereby become quite at\\r\\nease in manner, quite self-possessed in company.  Not always, though:\\r\\nLedyard, the great New England traveller, and Mungo Park, the Scotch\\r\\none; of all men, they possessed the least assurance in the parlor.\\r\\nBut perhaps the mere crossing of Siberia in a sledge drawn by dogs as\\r\\nLedyard did, or the taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomach,\\r\\nin the negro heart of Africa, which was the sum of poor Mungo\\'s\\r\\nperformances--this kind of travel, I say, may not be the very best\\r\\nmode of attaining a high social polish.  Still, for the most part,\\r\\nthat sort of thing is to be had anywhere.\\r\\n\\r\\nThese reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance that\\r\\nafter we were all seated at the table, and I was preparing to hear\\r\\nsome good stories about whaling; to my no small surprise, nearly\\r\\nevery man maintained a profound silence.  And not only that, but they\\r\\nlooked embarrassed.  Yes, here were a set of sea-dogs, many of whom\\r\\nwithout the slightest bashfulness had boarded great whales on the\\r\\nhigh seas--entire strangers to them--and duelled them dead without\\r\\nwinking; and yet, here they sat at a social breakfast table--all of\\r\\nthe same calling, all of kindred tastes--looking round as sheepishly\\r\\nat each other as though they had never been out of sight of some\\r\\nsheepfold among the Green Mountains.  A curious sight; these bashful\\r\\nbears, these timid warrior whalemen!\\r\\n\\r\\nBut as for Queequeg--why, Queequeg sat there among them--at the head\\r\\nof the table, too, it so chanced; as cool as an icicle.  To be sure I\\r\\ncannot say much for his breeding.  His greatest admirer could not\\r\\nhave cordially justified his bringing his harpoon into breakfast with\\r\\nhim, and using it there without ceremony; reaching over the table\\r\\nwith it, to the imminent jeopardy of many heads, and grappling the\\r\\nbeefsteaks towards him.  But THAT was certainly very coolly done by\\r\\nhim, and every one knows that in most people\\'s estimation, to do\\r\\nanything coolly is to do it genteelly.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe will not speak of all Queequeg\\'s peculiarities here; how he\\r\\neschewed coffee and hot rolls, and applied his undivided attention to\\r\\nbeefsteaks, done rare.  Enough, that when breakfast was over he\\r\\nwithdrew like the rest into the public room, lighted his\\r\\ntomahawk-pipe, and was sitting there quietly digesting and smoking\\r\\nwith his inseparable hat on, when I sallied out for a stroll.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 6\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Street.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandish\\r\\nan individual as Queequeg circulating among the polite society of a\\r\\ncivilized town, that astonishment soon departed upon taking my first\\r\\ndaylight stroll through the streets of New Bedford.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn thoroughfares nigh the docks, any considerable seaport will\\r\\nfrequently offer to view the queerest looking nondescripts from\\r\\nforeign parts.  Even in Broadway and Chestnut streets, Mediterranean\\r\\nmariners will sometimes jostle the affrighted ladies.  Regent Street\\r\\nis not unknown to Lascars and Malays; and at Bombay, in the Apollo\\r\\nGreen, live Yankees have often scared the natives.  But New Bedford\\r\\nbeats all Water Street and Wapping.  In these last-mentioned haunts\\r\\nyou see only sailors; but in New Bedford, actual cannibals stand\\r\\nchatting at street corners; savages outright; many of whom yet carry\\r\\non their bones unholy flesh.  It makes a stranger stare.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut, besides the Feegeeans, Tongatobooarrs, Erromanggoans,\\r\\nPannangians, and Brighggians, and, besides the wild specimens of the\\r\\nwhaling-craft which unheeded reel about the streets, you will see\\r\\nother sights still more curious, certainly more comical.  There\\r\\nweekly arrive in this town scores of green Vermonters and New\\r\\nHampshire men, all athirst for gain and glory in the fishery.  They\\r\\nare mostly young, of stalwart frames; fellows who have felled\\r\\nforests, and now seek to drop the axe and snatch the whale-lance.\\r\\nMany are as green as the Green Mountains whence they came.  In some\\r\\nthings you would think them but a few hours old.  Look there! that\\r\\nchap strutting round the corner.  He wears a beaver hat and\\r\\nswallow-tailed coat, girdled with a sailor-belt and sheath-knife.\\r\\nHere comes another with a sou\\'-wester and a bombazine cloak.\\r\\n\\r\\nNo town-bred dandy will compare with a country-bred one--I mean a\\r\\ndownright bumpkin dandy--a fellow that, in the dog-days, will mow his\\r\\ntwo acres in buckskin gloves for fear of tanning his hands.  Now when\\r\\na country dandy like this takes it into his head to make a\\r\\ndistinguished reputation, and joins the great whale-fishery, you\\r\\nshould see the comical things he does upon reaching the seaport.  In\\r\\nbespeaking his sea-outfit, he orders bell-buttons to his waistcoats;\\r\\nstraps to his canvas trowsers.  Ah, poor Hay-Seed! how bitterly will\\r\\nburst those straps in the first howling gale, when thou art driven,\\r\\nstraps, buttons, and all, down the throat of the tempest.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut think not that this famous town has only harpooneers, cannibals,\\r\\nand bumpkins to show her visitors.  Not at all.  Still New Bedford is\\r\\na queer place.  Had it not been for us whalemen, that tract of land\\r\\nwould this day perhaps have been in as howling condition as the coast\\r\\nof Labrador.  As it is, parts of her back country are enough to\\r\\nfrighten one, they look so bony.  The town itself is perhaps the\\r\\ndearest place to live in, in all New England.  It is a land of oil,\\r\\ntrue enough: but not like Canaan; a land, also, of corn and wine.\\r\\nThe streets do not run with milk; nor in the spring-time do they pave\\r\\nthem with fresh eggs.  Yet, in spite of this, nowhere in all America\\r\\nwill you find more patrician-like houses; parks and gardens more\\r\\nopulent, than in New Bedford.  Whence came they? how planted upon\\r\\nthis once scraggy scoria of a country?\\r\\n\\r\\nGo and gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoons round yonder lofty\\r\\nmansion, and your question will be answered.  Yes; all these brave\\r\\nhouses and flowery gardens came from the Atlantic, Pacific, and\\r\\nIndian oceans.  One and all, they were harpooned and dragged up\\r\\nhither from the bottom of the sea.  Can Herr Alexander perform a feat\\r\\nlike that?\\r\\n\\r\\nIn New Bedford, fathers, they say, give whales for dowers to their\\r\\ndaughters, and portion off their nieces with a few porpoises a-piece.\\r\\nYou must go to New Bedford to see a brilliant wedding; for, they\\r\\nsay, they have reservoirs of oil in every house, and every night\\r\\nrecklessly burn their lengths in spermaceti candles.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn summer time, the town is sweet to see; full of fine maples--long\\r\\navenues of green and gold.  And in August, high in air, the beautiful\\r\\nand bountiful horse-chestnuts, candelabra-wise, proffer the passer-by\\r\\ntheir tapering upright cones of congregated blossoms.  So omnipotent\\r\\nis art; which in many a district of New Bedford has superinduced\\r\\nbright terraces of flowers upon the barren refuse rocks thrown aside\\r\\nat creation\\'s final day.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the women of New Bedford, they bloom like their own red roses.\\r\\nBut roses only bloom in summer; whereas the fine carnation of their\\r\\ncheeks is perennial as sunlight in the seventh heavens.  Elsewhere\\r\\nmatch that bloom of theirs, ye cannot, save in Salem, where they tell\\r\\nme the young girls breathe such musk, their sailor sweethearts smell\\r\\nthem miles off shore, as though they were drawing nigh the odorous\\r\\nMoluccas instead of the Puritanic sands.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 7\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Chapel.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this same New Bedford there stands a Whaleman\\'s Chapel, and few\\r\\nare the moody fishermen, shortly bound for the Indian Ocean or\\r\\nPacific, who fail to make a Sunday visit to the spot.  I am sure that\\r\\nI did not.\\r\\n\\r\\nReturning from my first morning stroll, I again sallied out upon this\\r\\nspecial errand.  The sky had changed from clear, sunny cold, to\\r\\ndriving sleet and mist.  Wrapping myself in my shaggy jacket of the\\r\\ncloth called bearskin, I fought my way against the stubborn storm.\\r\\nEntering, I found a small scattered congregation of sailors, and\\r\\nsailors\\' wives and widows.  A muffled silence reigned, only broken at\\r\\ntimes by the shrieks of the storm.  Each silent worshipper seemed\\r\\npurposely sitting apart from the other, as if each silent grief were\\r\\ninsular and incommunicable.  The chaplain had not yet arrived; and\\r\\nthere these silent islands of men and women sat steadfastly eyeing\\r\\nseveral marble tablets, with black borders, masoned into the wall on\\r\\neither side the pulpit.  Three of them ran something like the\\r\\nfollowing, but I do not pretend to quote:--\\r\\n\\r\\nSACRED\\r\\nTO THE MEMORY\\r\\nOF\\r\\nJOHN TALBOT,\\r\\nWho, at the age of eighteen, was lost overboard,\\r\\nNear the Isle of Desolation, off Patagonia,\\r\\nNovember 1st, 1836.\\r\\nTHIS TABLET\\r\\nIs erected to his Memory\\r\\nBY HIS\\r\\nSISTER.\\r\\n_____________\\r\\n\\r\\nSACRED\\r\\nTO THE MEMORY\\r\\nOF\\r\\nROBERT LONG, WILLIS ELLERY,\\r\\nNATHAN COLEMAN, WALTER CANNY, SETH MACY,\\r\\nAND SAMUEL GLEIG,\\r\\nForming one of the boats\\' crews\\r\\nOF\\r\\nTHE SHIP ELIZA\\r\\nWho were towed out of sight by a Whale,\\r\\nOn the Off-shore Ground in the\\r\\nPACIFIC,\\r\\nDecember 31st, 1839.\\r\\nTHIS MARBLE\\r\\nIs here placed by their surviving\\r\\nSHIPMATES.\\r\\n_____________\\r\\n\\r\\nSACRED\\r\\nTO THE MEMORY\\r\\nOF\\r\\nThe late\\r\\nCAPTAIN EZEKIEL HARDY,\\r\\nWho in the bows of his boat was killed by a\\r\\nSperm Whale on the coast of Japan,\\r\\nAUGUST 3d, 1833.\\r\\nTHIS TABLET\\r\\nIs erected to his Memory\\r\\nBY\\r\\nHIS WIDOW.\\r\\n\\r\\nShaking off the sleet from my ice-glazed hat and jacket, I seated\\r\\nmyself near the door, and turning sideways was surprised to see\\r\\nQueequeg near me.  Affected by the solemnity of the scene, there was\\r\\na wondering gaze of incredulous curiosity in his countenance.  This\\r\\nsavage was the only person present who seemed to notice my entrance;\\r\\nbecause he was the only one who could not read, and, therefore, was\\r\\nnot reading those frigid inscriptions on the wall.  Whether any of\\r\\nthe relatives of the seamen whose names appeared there were now among\\r\\nthe congregation, I knew not; but so many are the unrecorded\\r\\naccidents in the fishery, and so plainly did several women present\\r\\nwear the countenance if not the trappings of some unceasing grief,\\r\\nthat I feel sure that here before me were assembled those, in whose\\r\\nunhealing hearts the sight of those bleak tablets sympathetically\\r\\ncaused the old wounds to bleed afresh.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh! ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass; who standing\\r\\namong flowers can say--here, HERE lies my beloved; ye know not the\\r\\ndesolation that broods in bosoms like these.  What bitter blanks in\\r\\nthose black-bordered marbles which cover no ashes!  What despair in\\r\\nthose immovable inscriptions!  What deadly voids and unbidden\\r\\ninfidelities in the lines that seem to gnaw upon all Faith, and\\r\\nrefuse resurrections to the beings who have placelessly perished\\r\\nwithout a grave.  As well might those tablets stand in the cave of\\r\\nElephanta as here.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn what census of living creatures, the dead of mankind are included;\\r\\nwhy it is that a universal proverb says of them, that they tell no\\r\\ntales, though containing more secrets than the Goodwin Sands; how it\\r\\nis that to his name who yesterday departed for the other world, we\\r\\nprefix so significant and infidel a word, and yet do not thus entitle\\r\\nhim, if he but embarks for the remotest Indies of this living earth;\\r\\nwhy the Life Insurance Companies pay death-forfeitures upon\\r\\nimmortals; in what eternal, unstirring paralysis, and deadly,\\r\\nhopeless trance, yet lies antique Adam who died sixty round centuries\\r\\nago; how it is that we still refuse to be comforted for those who we\\r\\nnevertheless maintain are dwelling in unspeakable bliss; why all the\\r\\nliving so strive to hush all the dead; wherefore but the rumor of a\\r\\nknocking in a tomb will terrify a whole city.  All these things are\\r\\nnot without their meanings.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut Faith, like a jackal, feeds among the tombs, and even from these\\r\\ndead doubts she gathers her most vital hope.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt needs scarcely to be told, with what feelings, on the eve of a\\r\\nNantucket voyage, I regarded those marble tablets, and by the murky\\r\\nlight of that darkened, doleful day read the fate of the whalemen who\\r\\nhad gone before me.  Yes, Ishmael, the same fate may be thine.  But\\r\\nsomehow I grew merry again.  Delightful inducements to embark, fine\\r\\nchance for promotion, it seems--aye, a stove boat will make me an\\r\\nimmortal by brevet.  Yes, there is death in this business of\\r\\nwhaling--a speechlessly quick chaotic bundling of a man into\\r\\nEternity.  But what then?  Methinks we have hugely mistaken this\\r\\nmatter of Life and Death.  Methinks that what they call my shadow\\r\\nhere on earth is my true substance.  Methinks that in looking at\\r\\nthings spiritual, we are too much like oysters observing the sun\\r\\nthrough the water, and thinking that thick water the thinnest of air.\\r\\nMethinks my body is but the lees of my better being.  In fact take\\r\\nmy body who will, take it I say, it is not me.  And therefore three\\r\\ncheers for Nantucket; and come a stove boat and stove body when they\\r\\nwill, for stave my soul, Jove himself cannot.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 8\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Pulpit.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable\\r\\nrobustness entered; immediately as the storm-pelted door flew back\\r\\nupon admitting him, a quick regardful eyeing of him by all the\\r\\ncongregation, sufficiently attested that this fine old man was the\\r\\nchaplain.  Yes, it was the famous Father Mapple, so called by the\\r\\nwhalemen, among whom he was a very great favourite.  He had been a\\r\\nsailor and a harpooneer in his youth, but for many years past had\\r\\ndedicated his life to the ministry.  At the time I now write of,\\r\\nFather Mapple was in the hardy winter of a healthy old age; that sort\\r\\nof old age which seems merging into a second flowering youth, for\\r\\namong all the fissures of his wrinkles, there shone certain mild\\r\\ngleams of a newly developing bloom--the spring verdure peeping forth\\r\\neven beneath February\\'s snow.  No one having previously heard his\\r\\nhistory, could for the first time behold Father Mapple without the\\r\\nutmost interest, because there were certain engrafted clerical\\r\\npeculiarities about him, imputable to that adventurous maritime life\\r\\nhe had led.  When he entered I observed that he carried no umbrella,\\r\\nand certainly had not come in his carriage, for his tarpaulin hat ran\\r\\ndown with melting sleet, and his great pilot cloth jacket seemed\\r\\nalmost to drag him to the floor with the weight of the water it had\\r\\nabsorbed.  However, hat and coat and overshoes were one by one\\r\\nremoved, and hung up in a little space in an adjacent corner; when,\\r\\narrayed in a decent suit, he quietly approached the pulpit.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike most old fashioned pulpits, it was a very lofty one, and since a\\r\\nregular stairs to such a height would, by its long angle with the\\r\\nfloor, seriously contract the already small area of the chapel, the\\r\\narchitect, it seemed, had acted upon the hint of Father Mapple, and\\r\\nfinished the pulpit without a stairs, substituting a perpendicular\\r\\nside ladder, like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea.\\r\\nThe wife of a whaling captain had provided the chapel with a handsome\\r\\npair of red worsted man-ropes for this ladder, which, being itself\\r\\nnicely headed, and stained with a mahogany colour, the whole\\r\\ncontrivance, considering what manner of chapel it was, seemed by no\\r\\nmeans in bad taste.  Halting for an instant at the foot of the\\r\\nladder, and with both hands grasping the ornamental knobs of the\\r\\nman-ropes, Father Mapple cast a look upwards, and then with a truly\\r\\nsailor-like but still reverential dexterity, hand over hand, mounted\\r\\nthe steps as if ascending the main-top of his vessel.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe perpendicular parts of this side ladder, as is usually the case\\r\\nwith swinging ones, were of cloth-covered rope, only the rounds were\\r\\nof wood, so that at every step there was a joint.  At my first\\r\\nglimpse of the pulpit, it had not escaped me that however convenient\\r\\nfor a ship, these joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary.\\r\\nFor I was not prepared to see Father Mapple after gaining the height,\\r\\nslowly turn round, and stooping over the pulpit, deliberately drag up\\r\\nthe ladder step by step, till the whole was deposited within, leaving\\r\\nhim impregnable in his little Quebec.\\r\\n\\r\\nI pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this.\\r\\nFather Mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and\\r\\nsanctity, that I could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any\\r\\nmere tricks of the stage.  No, thought I, there must be some sober\\r\\nreason for this thing; furthermore, it must symbolize something\\r\\nunseen.  Can it be, then, that by that act of physical isolation, he\\r\\nsignifies his spiritual withdrawal for the time, from all outward\\r\\nworldly ties and connexions?  Yes, for replenished with the meat and\\r\\nwine of the word, to the faithful man of God, this pulpit, I see, is\\r\\na self-containing stronghold--a lofty Ehrenbreitstein, with a\\r\\nperennial well of water within the walls.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place,\\r\\nborrowed from the chaplain\\'s former sea-farings.  Between the marble\\r\\ncenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit, the wall which formed its\\r\\nback was adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship\\r\\nbeating against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and\\r\\nsnowy breakers.  But high above the flying scud and dark-rolling\\r\\nclouds, there floated a little isle of sunlight, from which beamed\\r\\nforth an angel\\'s face; and this bright face shed a distinct spot of\\r\\nradiance upon the ship\\'s tossed deck, something like that silver\\r\\nplate now inserted into the Victory\\'s plank where Nelson fell.  \"Ah,\\r\\nnoble ship,\" the angel seemed to say, \"beat on, beat on, thou noble\\r\\nship, and bear a hardy helm; for lo! the sun is breaking through; the\\r\\nclouds are rolling off--serenest azure is at hand.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nNor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same sea-taste that\\r\\nhad achieved the ladder and the picture.  Its panelled front was in\\r\\nthe likeness of a ship\\'s bluff bows, and the Holy Bible rested on a\\r\\nprojecting piece of scroll work, fashioned after a ship\\'s\\r\\nfiddle-headed beak.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat could be more full of meaning?--for the pulpit is ever this\\r\\nearth\\'s foremost part; all the rest comes in its rear; the pulpit\\r\\nleads the world.  From thence it is the storm of God\\'s quick wrath is\\r\\nfirst descried, and the bow must bear the earliest brunt.  From\\r\\nthence it is the God of breezes fair or foul is first invoked for\\r\\nfavourable winds.  Yes, the world\\'s a ship on its passage out, and not\\r\\na voyage complete; and the pulpit is its prow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 9\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Sermon.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFather Mapple rose, and in a mild voice of unassuming authority\\r\\nordered the scattered people to condense.  \"Starboard gangway,\\r\\nthere! side away to larboard--larboard gangway to starboard!\\r\\nMidships! midships!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was a low rumbling of heavy sea-boots among the benches, and a\\r\\nstill slighter shuffling of women\\'s shoes, and all was quiet again,\\r\\nand every eye on the preacher.\\r\\n\\r\\nHe paused a little; then kneeling in the pulpit\\'s bows, folded his\\r\\nlarge brown hands across his chest, uplifted his closed eyes, and\\r\\noffered a prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling and praying\\r\\nat the bottom of the sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis ended, in prolonged solemn tones, like the continual tolling of\\r\\na bell in a ship that is foundering at sea in a fog--in such tones he\\r\\ncommenced reading the following hymn; but changing his manner towards\\r\\nthe concluding stanzas, burst forth with a pealing exultation and\\r\\njoy--\\r\\n\\r\\n\"The ribs and terrors in the whale,\\r\\nArched over me a dismal gloom,\\r\\nWhile all God\\'s sun-lit waves rolled by,\\r\\nAnd lift me deepening down to doom.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I saw the opening maw of hell,\\r\\nWith endless pains and sorrows there;\\r\\nWhich none but they that feel can tell--\\r\\nOh, I was plunging to despair.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"In black distress, I called my God,\\r\\nWhen I could scarce believe him mine,\\r\\nHe bowed his ear to my complaints--\\r\\nNo more the whale did me confine.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With speed he flew to my relief,\\r\\nAs on a radiant dolphin borne;\\r\\nAwful, yet bright, as lightning shone\\r\\nThe face of my Deliverer God.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"My song for ever shall record\\r\\nThat terrible, that joyful hour;\\r\\nI give the glory to my God,\\r\\nHis all the mercy and the power.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNearly all joined in singing this hymn, which swelled high above the\\r\\nhowling of the storm.  A brief pause ensued; the preacher slowly\\r\\nturned over the leaves of the Bible, and at last, folding his hand\\r\\ndown upon the proper page, said: \"Beloved shipmates, clinch the last\\r\\nverse of the first chapter of Jonah--\\'And God had prepared a great\\r\\nfish to swallow up Jonah.\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Shipmates, this book, containing only four chapters--four yarns--is\\r\\none of the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the Scriptures.\\r\\nYet what depths of the soul does Jonah\\'s deep sealine sound! what a\\r\\npregnant lesson to us is this prophet!  What a noble thing is that\\r\\ncanticle in the fish\\'s belly!  How billow-like and boisterously\\r\\ngrand!  We feel the floods surging over us; we sound with him to the\\r\\nkelpy bottom of the waters; sea-weed and all the slime of the sea is\\r\\nabout us!  But WHAT is this lesson that the book of Jonah teaches?\\r\\nShipmates, it is a two-stranded lesson; a lesson to us all as sinful\\r\\nmen, and a lesson to me as a pilot of the living God.  As sinful men,\\r\\nit is a lesson to us all, because it is a story of the sin,\\r\\nhard-heartedness, suddenly awakened fears, the swift punishment,\\r\\nrepentance, prayers, and finally the deliverance and joy of Jonah.\\r\\nAs with all sinners among men, the sin of this son of Amittai was in\\r\\nhis wilful disobedience of the command of God--never mind now what\\r\\nthat command was, or how conveyed--which he found a hard command.\\r\\nBut all the things that God would have us do are hard for us to\\r\\ndo--remember that--and hence, he oftener commands us than endeavors\\r\\nto persuade.  And if we obey God, we must disobey ourselves; and it\\r\\nis in this disobeying ourselves, wherein the hardness of obeying God\\r\\nconsists.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"With this sin of disobedience in him, Jonah still further flouts at\\r\\nGod, by seeking to flee from Him.  He thinks that a ship made by men\\r\\nwill carry him into countries where God does not reign, but only the\\r\\nCaptains of this earth.  He skulks about the wharves of Joppa, and\\r\\nseeks a ship that\\'s bound for Tarshish.  There lurks, perhaps, a\\r\\nhitherto unheeded meaning here.  By all accounts Tarshish could have\\r\\nbeen no other city than the modern Cadiz.  That\\'s the opinion of\\r\\nlearned men.  And where is Cadiz, shipmates?  Cadiz is in Spain; as\\r\\nfar by water, from Joppa, as Jonah could possibly have sailed in\\r\\nthose ancient days, when the Atlantic was an almost unknown sea.\\r\\nBecause Joppa, the modern Jaffa, shipmates, is on the most easterly\\r\\ncoast of the Mediterranean, the Syrian; and Tarshish or Cadiz more\\r\\nthan two thousand miles to the westward from that, just outside the\\r\\nStraits of Gibraltar.  See ye not then, shipmates, that Jonah sought\\r\\nto flee world-wide from God?  Miserable man!  Oh! most contemptible\\r\\nand worthy of all scorn; with slouched hat and guilty eye, skulking\\r\\nfrom his God; prowling among the shipping like a vile burglar\\r\\nhastening to cross the seas.  So disordered, self-condemning is his\\r\\nlook, that had there been policemen in those days, Jonah, on the mere\\r\\nsuspicion of something wrong, had been arrested ere he touched a\\r\\ndeck.  How plainly he\\'s a fugitive! no baggage, not a hat-box,\\r\\nvalise, or carpet-bag,--no friends accompany him to the wharf with\\r\\ntheir adieux.  At last, after much dodging search, he finds the\\r\\nTarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo; and as he steps\\r\\non board to see its Captain in the cabin, all the sailors for the\\r\\nmoment desist from hoisting in the goods, to mark the stranger\\'s evil\\r\\neye.  Jonah sees this; but in vain he tries to look all ease and\\r\\nconfidence; in vain essays his wretched smile.  Strong intuitions of\\r\\nthe man assure the mariners he can be no innocent.  In their gamesome\\r\\nbut still serious way, one whispers to the other--\"Jack, he\\'s robbed\\r\\na widow;\" or, \"Joe, do you mark him; he\\'s a bigamist;\" or, \"Harry\\r\\nlad, I guess he\\'s the adulterer that broke jail in old Gomorrah, or\\r\\nbelike, one of the missing murderers from Sodom.\"  Another runs to\\r\\nread the bill that\\'s stuck against the spile upon the wharf to which\\r\\nthe ship is moored, offering five hundred gold coins for the\\r\\napprehension of a parricide, and containing a description of his\\r\\nperson.  He reads, and looks from Jonah to the bill; while all his\\r\\nsympathetic shipmates now crowd round Jonah, prepared to lay their\\r\\nhands upon him.  Frighted Jonah trembles, and summoning all his\\r\\nboldness to his face, only looks so much the more a coward.  He will\\r\\nnot confess himself suspected; but that itself is strong suspicion.\\r\\nSo he makes the best of it; and when the sailors find him not to be\\r\\nthe man that is advertised, they let him pass, and he descends into\\r\\nthe cabin.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'Who\\'s there?\\' cries the Captain at his busy desk, hurriedly making\\r\\nout his papers for the Customs--\\'Who\\'s there?\\'  Oh! how that harmless\\r\\nquestion mangles Jonah!  For the instant he almost turns to flee\\r\\nagain.  But he rallies.  \\'I seek a passage in this ship to Tarshish;\\r\\nhow soon sail ye, sir?\\'  Thus far the busy Captain had not looked up\\r\\nto Jonah, though the man now stands before him; but no sooner does he\\r\\nhear that hollow voice, than he darts a scrutinizing glance.  \\'We\\r\\nsail with the next coming tide,\\' at last he slowly answered, still\\r\\nintently eyeing him.  \\'No sooner, sir?\\'--\\'Soon enough for any honest\\r\\nman that goes a passenger.\\'  Ha!  Jonah, that\\'s another stab.  But he\\r\\nswiftly calls away the Captain from that scent.  \\'I\\'ll sail with\\r\\nye,\\'--he says,--\\'the passage money how much is that?--I\\'ll pay now.\\'\\r\\nFor it is particularly written, shipmates, as if it were a thing not\\r\\nto be overlooked in this history, \\'that he paid the fare thereof\\' ere\\r\\nthe craft did sail.  And taken with the context, this is full of\\r\\nmeaning.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Now Jonah\\'s Captain, shipmates, was one whose discernment detects\\r\\ncrime in any, but whose cupidity exposes it only in the penniless.\\r\\nIn this world, shipmates, sin that pays its way can travel freely,\\r\\nand without a passport; whereas Virtue, if a pauper, is stopped at\\r\\nall frontiers.  So Jonah\\'s Captain prepares to test the length of\\r\\nJonah\\'s purse, ere he judge him openly.  He charges him thrice the\\r\\nusual sum; and it\\'s assented to.  Then the Captain knows that Jonah\\r\\nis a fugitive; but at the same time resolves to help a flight that\\r\\npaves its rear with gold.  Yet when Jonah fairly takes out his purse,\\r\\nprudent suspicions still molest the Captain.  He rings every coin to\\r\\nfind a counterfeit.  Not a forger, any way, he mutters; and Jonah is\\r\\nput down for his passage.  \\'Point out my state-room, Sir,\\' says Jonah\\r\\nnow, \\'I\\'m travel-weary; I need sleep.\\'  \\'Thou lookest like it,\\' says\\r\\nthe Captain, \\'there\\'s thy room.\\'  Jonah enters, and would lock the\\r\\ndoor, but the lock contains no key.  Hearing him foolishly fumbling\\r\\nthere, the Captain laughs lowly to himself, and mutters something\\r\\nabout the doors of convicts\\' cells being never allowed to be locked\\r\\nwithin.  All dressed and dusty as he is, Jonah throws himself into\\r\\nhis berth, and finds the little state-room ceiling almost resting on\\r\\nhis forehead.  The air is close, and Jonah gasps.  Then, in that\\r\\ncontracted hole, sunk, too, beneath the ship\\'s water-line, Jonah\\r\\nfeels the heralding presentiment of that stifling hour, when the\\r\\nwhale shall hold him in the smallest of his bowels\\' wards.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Screwed at its axis against the side, a swinging lamp slightly\\r\\noscillates in Jonah\\'s room; and the ship, heeling over towards the\\r\\nwharf with the weight of the last bales received, the lamp, flame and\\r\\nall, though in slight motion, still maintains a permanent obliquity\\r\\nwith reference to the room; though, in truth, infallibly straight\\r\\nitself, it but made obvious the false, lying levels among which it\\r\\nhung.  The lamp alarms and frightens Jonah; as lying in his berth his\\r\\ntormented eyes roll round the place, and this thus far successful\\r\\nfugitive finds no refuge for his restless glance.  But that\\r\\ncontradiction in the lamp more and more appals him.  The floor, the\\r\\nceiling, and the side, are all awry.  \\'Oh! so my conscience hangs in\\r\\nme!\\' he groans, \\'straight upwards, so it burns; but the chambers of\\r\\nmy soul are all in crookedness!\\'\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Like one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed, still\\r\\nreeling, but with conscience yet pricking him, as the plungings of\\r\\nthe Roman race-horse but so much the more strike his steel tags into\\r\\nhim; as one who in that miserable plight still turns and turns in\\r\\ngiddy anguish, praying God for annihilation until the fit be passed;\\r\\nand at last amid the whirl of woe he feels, a deep stupor steals over\\r\\nhim, as over the man who bleeds to death, for conscience is the\\r\\nwound, and there\\'s naught to staunch it; so, after sore wrestlings in\\r\\nhis berth, Jonah\\'s prodigy of ponderous misery drags him drowning\\r\\ndown to sleep.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And now the time of tide has come; the ship casts off her cables;\\r\\nand from the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for Tarshish, all\\r\\ncareening, glides to sea.  That ship, my friends, was the first of\\r\\nrecorded smugglers! the contraband was Jonah.  But the sea rebels; he\\r\\nwill not bear the wicked burden.  A dreadful storm comes on, the\\r\\nship is like to break.  But now when the boatswain calls all hands to\\r\\nlighten her; when boxes, bales, and jars are clattering overboard;\\r\\nwhen the wind is shrieking, and the men are yelling, and every plank\\r\\nthunders with trampling feet right over Jonah\\'s head; in all this\\r\\nraging tumult, Jonah sleeps his hideous sleep.  He sees no black sky\\r\\nand raging sea, feels not the reeling timbers, and little hears he or\\r\\nheeds he the far rush of the mighty whale, which even now with open\\r\\nmouth is cleaving the seas after him.  Aye, shipmates, Jonah was gone\\r\\ndown into the sides of the ship--a berth in the cabin as I have taken\\r\\nit, and was fast asleep.  But the frightened master comes to him, and\\r\\nshrieks in his dead ear, \\'What meanest thou, O, sleeper! arise!\\'\\r\\nStartled from his lethargy by that direful cry, Jonah staggers to his\\r\\nfeet, and stumbling to the deck, grasps a shroud, to look out upon\\r\\nthe sea.  But at that moment he is sprung upon by a panther billow\\r\\nleaping over the bulwarks.  Wave after wave thus leaps into the ship,\\r\\nand finding no speedy vent runs roaring fore and aft, till the\\r\\nmariners come nigh to drowning while yet afloat.  And ever, as the\\r\\nwhite moon shows her affrighted face from the steep gullies in the\\r\\nblackness overhead, aghast Jonah sees the rearing bowsprit pointing\\r\\nhigh upward, but soon beat downward again towards the tormented deep.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Terrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul.  In all his\\r\\ncringing attitudes, the God-fugitive is now too plainly known.  The\\r\\nsailors mark him; more and more certain grow their suspicions of him,\\r\\nand at last, fully to test the truth, by referring the whole matter\\r\\nto high Heaven, they fall to casting lots, to see for whose\\r\\ncause this great tempest was upon them.  The lot is Jonah\\'s; that\\r\\ndiscovered, then how furiously they mob him with their questions.\\r\\n\\'What is thine occupation?  Whence comest thou?  Thy country?  What\\r\\npeople?  But mark now, my shipmates, the behavior of poor Jonah.  The\\r\\neager mariners but ask him who he is, and where from; whereas, they\\r\\nnot only receive an answer to those questions, but likewise another\\r\\nanswer to a question not put by them, but the unsolicited answer is\\r\\nforced from Jonah by the hard hand of God that is upon him.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"\\'I am a Hebrew,\\' he cries--and then--\\'I fear the Lord the God of\\r\\nHeaven who hath made the sea and the dry land!\\'  Fear him, O Jonah?\\r\\nAye, well mightest thou fear the Lord God THEN!  Straightway, he now\\r\\ngoes on to make a full confession; whereupon the mariners became more\\r\\nand more appalled, but still are pitiful.  For when Jonah, not yet\\r\\nsupplicating God for mercy, since he but too well knew the darkness\\r\\nof his deserts,--when wretched Jonah cries out to them to take him\\r\\nand cast him forth into the sea, for he knew that for HIS sake this\\r\\ngreat tempest was upon them; they mercifully turn from him, and seek\\r\\nby other means to save the ship.  But all in vain; the indignant gale\\r\\nhowls louder; then, with one hand raised invokingly to God, with the\\r\\nother they not unreluctantly lay hold of Jonah.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And now behold Jonah taken up as an anchor and dropped into the sea;\\r\\nwhen instantly an oily calmness floats out from the east, and the sea\\r\\nis still, as Jonah carries down the gale with him, leaving smooth\\r\\nwater behind.  He goes down in the whirling heart of such a\\r\\nmasterless commotion that he scarce heeds the moment when he drops\\r\\nseething into the yawning jaws awaiting him; and the whale shoots-to\\r\\nall his ivory teeth, like so many white bolts, upon his prison.  Then\\r\\nJonah prayed unto the Lord out of the fish\\'s belly.  But observe his\\r\\nprayer, and learn a weighty lesson.  For sinful as he is, Jonah does\\r\\nnot weep and wail for direct deliverance.  He feels that his dreadful\\r\\npunishment is just.  He leaves all his deliverance to God, contenting\\r\\nhimself with this, that spite of all his pains and pangs, he will\\r\\nstill look towards His holy temple.  And here, shipmates, is true and\\r\\nfaithful repentance; not clamorous for pardon, but grateful for\\r\\npunishment.  And how pleasing to God was this conduct in Jonah, is\\r\\nshown in the eventual deliverance of him from the sea and the whale.\\r\\nShipmates, I do not place Jonah before you to be copied for his sin\\r\\nbut I do place him before you as a model for repentance.  Sin not;\\r\\nbut if you do, take heed to repent of it like Jonah.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile he was speaking these words, the howling of the shrieking,\\r\\nslanting storm without seemed to add new power to the preacher, who,\\r\\nwhen describing Jonah\\'s sea-storm, seemed tossed by a storm himself.\\r\\nHis deep chest heaved as with a ground-swell; his tossed arms seemed\\r\\nthe warring elements at work; and the thunders that rolled away from\\r\\noff his swarthy brow, and the light leaping from his eye, made all\\r\\nhis simple hearers look on him with a quick fear that was strange to\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere now came a lull in his look, as he silently turned over the\\r\\nleaves of the Book once more; and, at last, standing motionless, with\\r\\nclosed eyes, for the moment, seemed communing with God and himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut again he leaned over towards the people, and bowing his head\\r\\nlowly, with an aspect of the deepest yet manliest humility, he spake\\r\\nthese words:\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Shipmates, God has laid but one hand upon you; both his hands press\\r\\nupon me.  I have read ye by what murky light may be mine the lesson\\r\\nthat Jonah teaches to all sinners; and therefore to ye, and still\\r\\nmore to me, for I am a greater sinner than ye.  And now how gladly\\r\\nwould I come down from this mast-head and sit on the hatches there\\r\\nwhere you sit, and listen as you listen, while some one of you reads\\r\\nME that other and more awful lesson which Jonah teaches to ME, as a\\r\\npilot of the living God.  How being an anointed pilot-prophet, or\\r\\nspeaker of true things, and bidden by the Lord to sound those\\r\\nunwelcome truths in the ears of a wicked Nineveh, Jonah, appalled at\\r\\nthe hostility he should raise, fled from his mission, and sought to\\r\\nescape his duty and his God by taking ship at Joppa.  But God is\\r\\neverywhere; Tarshish he never reached.  As we have seen, God came\\r\\nupon him in the whale, and swallowed him down to living gulfs of\\r\\ndoom, and with swift slantings tore him along \\'into the midst of the\\r\\nseas,\\' where the eddying depths sucked him ten thousand fathoms down,\\r\\nand \\'the weeds were wrapped about his head,\\' and all the watery world\\r\\nof woe bowled over him.  Yet even then beyond the reach of any\\r\\nplummet--\\'out of the belly of hell\\'--when the whale grounded upon the\\r\\nocean\\'s utmost bones, even then, God heard the engulphed, repenting\\r\\nprophet when he cried.  Then God spake unto the fish; and from the\\r\\nshuddering cold and blackness of the sea, the whale came breeching up\\r\\ntowards the warm and pleasant sun, and all the delights of air and\\r\\nearth; and \\'vomited out Jonah upon the dry land;\\' when the word of\\r\\nthe Lord came a second time; and Jonah, bruised and beaten--his ears,\\r\\nlike two sea-shells, still multitudinously murmuring of the\\r\\nocean--Jonah did the Almighty\\'s bidding.  And what was that,\\r\\nshipmates?  To preach the Truth to the face of Falsehood!  That was\\r\\nit!\\r\\n\\r\\n\"This, shipmates, this is that other lesson; and woe to that pilot of\\r\\nthe living God who slights it.  Woe to him whom this world charms\\r\\nfrom Gospel duty!  Woe to him who seeks to pour oil upon the waters\\r\\nwhen God has brewed them into a gale!  Woe to him who seeks to please\\r\\nrather than to appal!  Woe to him whose good name is more to him than\\r\\ngoodness!  Woe to him who, in this world, courts not dishonour!  Woe\\r\\nto him who would not be true, even though to be false were salvation!\\r\\nYea, woe to him who, as the great Pilot Paul has it, while preaching\\r\\nto others is himself a castaway!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe dropped and fell away from himself for a moment; then lifting his\\r\\nface to them again, showed a deep joy in his eyes, as he cried out\\r\\nwith a heavenly enthusiasm,--\"But oh! shipmates! on the starboard\\r\\nhand of every woe, there is a sure delight; and higher the top of\\r\\nthat delight, than the bottom of the woe is deep.  Is not the\\r\\nmain-truck higher than the kelson is low?  Delight is to him--a far,\\r\\nfar upward, and inward delight--who against the proud gods and\\r\\ncommodores of this earth, ever stands forth his own inexorable self.\\r\\nDelight is to him whose strong arms yet support him, when the ship of\\r\\nthis base treacherous world has gone down beneath him.  Delight is to\\r\\nhim, who gives no quarter in the truth, and kills, burns, and\\r\\ndestroys all sin though he pluck it out from under the robes of\\r\\nSenators and Judges.  Delight,--top-gallant delight is to him, who\\r\\nacknowledges no law or lord, but the Lord his God, and is only a\\r\\npatriot to heaven.  Delight is to him, whom all the waves of the\\r\\nbillows of the seas of the boisterous mob can never shake from this\\r\\nsure Keel of the Ages.  And eternal delight and deliciousness will be\\r\\nhis, who coming to lay him down, can say with his final breath--O\\r\\nFather!--chiefly known to me by Thy rod--mortal or immortal, here I\\r\\ndie.  I have striven to be Thine, more than to be this world\\'s, or\\r\\nmine own.  Yet this is nothing: I leave eternity to Thee; for what\\r\\nis man that he should live out the lifetime of his God?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHe said no more, but slowly waving a benediction, covered his face\\r\\nwith his hands, and so remained kneeling, till all the people had\\r\\ndeparted, and he was left alone in the place.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 10\\r\\n\\r\\nA Bosom Friend.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nReturning to the Spouter-Inn from the Chapel, I found Queequeg there\\r\\nquite alone; he having left the Chapel before the benediction some\\r\\ntime.  He was sitting on a bench before the fire, with his feet on\\r\\nthe stove hearth, and in one hand was holding close up to his face\\r\\nthat little negro idol of his; peering hard into its face, and with a\\r\\njack-knife gently whittling away at its nose, meanwhile humming to\\r\\nhimself in his heathenish way.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut being now interrupted, he put up the image; and pretty soon,\\r\\ngoing to the table, took up a large book there, and placing it on his\\r\\nlap began counting the pages with deliberate regularity; at every\\r\\nfiftieth page--as I fancied--stopping a moment, looking vacantly\\r\\naround him, and giving utterance to a long-drawn gurgling whistle of\\r\\nastonishment.  He would then begin again at the next fifty; seeming\\r\\nto commence at number one each time, as though he could not count\\r\\nmore than fifty, and it was only by such a large number of fifties\\r\\nbeing found together, that his astonishment at the multitude of pages\\r\\nwas excited.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith much interest I sat watching him.  Savage though he was, and\\r\\nhideously marred about the face--at least to my taste--his\\r\\ncountenance yet had a something in it which was by no means\\r\\ndisagreeable.  You cannot hide the soul.  Through all his unearthly\\r\\ntattooings, I thought I saw the traces of a simple honest heart; and\\r\\nin his large, deep eyes, fiery black and bold, there seemed tokens of\\r\\na spirit that would dare a thousand devils.  And besides all this,\\r\\nthere was a certain lofty bearing about the Pagan, which even his\\r\\nuncouthness could not altogether maim.  He looked like a man who had\\r\\nnever cringed and never had had a creditor.  Whether it was, too,\\r\\nthat his head being shaved, his forehead was drawn out in freer and\\r\\nbrighter relief, and looked more expansive than it otherwise would,\\r\\nthis I will not venture to decide; but certain it was his head was\\r\\nphrenologically an excellent one.  It may seem ridiculous, but it\\r\\nreminded me of General Washington\\'s head, as seen in the popular\\r\\nbusts of him.  It had the same long regularly graded retreating slope\\r\\nfrom above the brows, which were likewise very projecting, like two\\r\\nlong promontories thickly wooded on top.  Queequeg was George\\r\\nWashington cannibalistically developed.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhilst I was thus closely scanning him, half-pretending meanwhile to\\r\\nbe looking out at the storm from the casement, he never heeded my\\r\\npresence, never troubled himself with so much as a single glance; but\\r\\nappeared wholly occupied with counting the pages of the marvellous\\r\\nbook.  Considering how sociably we had been sleeping together the\\r\\nnight previous, and especially considering the affectionate arm I had\\r\\nfound thrown over me upon waking in the morning, I thought this\\r\\nindifference of his very strange.  But savages are strange beings; at\\r\\ntimes you do not know exactly how to take them.  At first they are\\r\\noverawing; their calm self-collectedness of simplicity seems a\\r\\nSocratic wisdom.  I had noticed also that Queequeg never consorted at\\r\\nall, or but very little, with the other seamen in the inn.  He made\\r\\nno advances whatever; appeared to have no desire to enlarge the\\r\\ncircle of his acquaintances.  All this struck me as mighty singular;\\r\\nyet, upon second thoughts, there was something almost sublime in it.\\r\\nHere was a man some twenty thousand miles from home, by the way of\\r\\nCape Horn, that is--which was the only way he could get there--thrown\\r\\namong people as strange to him as though he were in the planet\\r\\nJupiter; and yet he seemed entirely at his ease; preserving the\\r\\nutmost serenity; content with his own companionship; always equal to\\r\\nhimself.  Surely this was a touch of fine philosophy; though no doubt\\r\\nhe had never heard there was such a thing as that.  But, perhaps, to\\r\\nbe true philosophers, we mortals should not be conscious of so living\\r\\nor so striving.  So soon as I hear that such or such a man gives\\r\\nhimself out for a philosopher, I conclude that, like the dyspeptic\\r\\nold woman, he must have \"broken his digester.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I sat there in that now lonely room; the fire burning low, in that\\r\\nmild stage when, after its first intensity has warmed the air, it\\r\\nthen only glows to be looked at; the evening shades and phantoms\\r\\ngathering round the casements, and peering in upon us silent,\\r\\nsolitary twain; the storm booming without in solemn swells; I began\\r\\nto be sensible of strange feelings.  I felt a melting in me.  No more\\r\\nmy splintered heart and maddened hand were turned against the wolfish\\r\\nworld.  This soothing savage had redeemed it.  There he sat, his very\\r\\nindifference speaking a nature in which there lurked no civilized\\r\\nhypocrisies and bland deceits.  Wild he was; a very sight of sights\\r\\nto see; yet I began to feel myself mysteriously drawn towards him.\\r\\nAnd those same things that would have repelled most others, they were\\r\\nthe very magnets that thus drew me.  I\\'ll try a pagan friend, thought\\r\\nI, since Christian kindness has proved but hollow courtesy.  I drew\\r\\nmy bench near him, and made some friendly signs and hints, doing my\\r\\nbest to talk with him meanwhile.  At first he little noticed these\\r\\nadvances; but presently, upon my referring to his last night\\'s\\r\\nhospitalities, he made out to ask me whether we were again to be\\r\\nbedfellows.  I told him yes; whereat I thought he looked pleased,\\r\\nperhaps a little complimented.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe then turned over the book together, and I endeavored to explain to\\r\\nhim the purpose of the printing, and the meaning of the few pictures\\r\\nthat were in it.  Thus I soon engaged his interest; and from that we\\r\\nwent to jabbering the best we could about the various outer sights to\\r\\nbe seen in this famous town.  Soon I proposed a social smoke; and,\\r\\nproducing his pouch and tomahawk, he quietly offered me a puff.  And\\r\\nthen we sat exchanging puffs from that wild pipe of his, and keeping\\r\\nit regularly passing between us.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf there yet lurked any ice of indifference towards me in the Pagan\\'s\\r\\nbreast, this pleasant, genial smoke we had, soon thawed it out, and\\r\\nleft us cronies.  He seemed to take to me quite as naturally and\\r\\nunbiddenly as I to him; and when our smoke was over, he pressed his\\r\\nforehead against mine, clasped me round the waist, and said that\\r\\nhenceforth we were married; meaning, in his country\\'s phrase, that we\\r\\nwere bosom friends; he would gladly die for me, if need should be.\\r\\nIn a countryman, this sudden flame of friendship would have seemed\\r\\nfar too premature, a thing to be much distrusted; but in this simple\\r\\nsavage those old rules would not apply.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter supper, and another social chat and smoke, we went to our room\\r\\ntogether.  He made me a present of his embalmed head; took out his\\r\\nenormous tobacco wallet, and groping under the tobacco, drew out some\\r\\nthirty dollars in silver; then spreading them on the table, and\\r\\nmechanically dividing them into two equal portions, pushed one of\\r\\nthem towards me, and said it was mine.  I was going to remonstrate;\\r\\nbut he silenced me by pouring them into my trowsers\\' pockets.  I let\\r\\nthem stay.  He then went about his evening prayers, took out his\\r\\nidol, and removed the paper fireboard.  By certain signs and\\r\\nsymptoms, I thought he seemed anxious for me to join him; but well\\r\\nknowing what was to follow, I deliberated a moment whether, in case\\r\\nhe invited me, I would comply or otherwise.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was a good Christian; born and bred in the bosom of the infallible\\r\\nPresbyterian Church.  How then could I unite with this wild idolator\\r\\nin worshipping his piece of wood?  But what is worship? thought I.\\r\\nDo you suppose now, Ishmael, that the magnanimous God of heaven and\\r\\nearth--pagans and all included--can possibly be jealous of an\\r\\ninsignificant bit of black wood?  Impossible!  But what is\\r\\nworship?--to do the will of God--THAT is worship.  And what is the\\r\\nwill of God?--to do to my fellow man what I would have my fellow man\\r\\nto do to me--THAT is the will of God.  Now, Queequeg is my fellow\\r\\nman.  And what do I wish that this Queequeg would do to me?  Why,\\r\\nunite with me in my particular Presbyterian form of worship.\\r\\nConsequently, I must then unite with him in his; ergo, I must turn\\r\\nidolator.  So I kindled the shavings; helped prop up the innocent\\r\\nlittle idol; offered him burnt biscuit with Queequeg; salamed before\\r\\nhim twice or thrice; kissed his nose; and that done, we undressed and\\r\\nwent to bed, at peace with our own consciences and all the world.\\r\\nBut we did not go to sleep without some little chat.\\r\\n\\r\\nHow it is I know not; but there is no place like a bed for\\r\\nconfidential disclosures between friends.  Man and wife, they say,\\r\\nthere open the very bottom of their souls to each other; and some old\\r\\ncouples often lie and chat over old times till nearly morning.  Thus,\\r\\nthen, in our hearts\\' honeymoon, lay I and Queequeg--a cosy, loving\\r\\npair.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 11\\r\\n\\r\\nNightgown.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had lain thus in bed, chatting and napping at short intervals, and\\r\\nQueequeg now and then affectionately throwing his brown tattooed legs\\r\\nover mine, and then drawing them back; so entirely sociable and free\\r\\nand easy were we; when, at last, by reason of our confabulations,\\r\\nwhat little nappishness remained in us altogether departed, and we\\r\\nfelt like getting up again, though day-break was yet some way down\\r\\nthe future.\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, we became very wakeful; so much so that our recumbent position\\r\\nbegan to grow wearisome, and by little and little we found ourselves\\r\\nsitting up; the clothes well tucked around us, leaning against the\\r\\nhead-board with our four knees drawn up close together, and our two\\r\\nnoses bending over them, as if our kneepans were warming-pans.  We\\r\\nfelt very nice and snug, the more so since it was so chilly out of\\r\\ndoors; indeed out of bed-clothes too, seeing that there was no fire\\r\\nin the room.  The more so, I say, because truly to enjoy bodily\\r\\nwarmth, some small part of you must be cold, for there is no quality\\r\\nin this world that is not what it is merely by contrast.  Nothing\\r\\nexists in itself.  If you flatter yourself that you are all over\\r\\ncomfortable, and have been so a long time, then you cannot be said to\\r\\nbe comfortable any more.  But if, like Queequeg and me in the bed,\\r\\nthe tip of your nose or the crown of your head be slightly chilled,\\r\\nwhy then, indeed, in the general consciousness you feel most\\r\\ndelightfully and unmistakably warm.  For this reason a sleeping\\r\\napartment should never be furnished with a fire, which is one of the\\r\\nluxurious discomforts of the rich.  For the height of this sort of\\r\\ndeliciousness is to have nothing but the blanket between you and\\r\\nyour snugness and the cold of the outer air.  Then there you lie like\\r\\nthe one warm spark in the heart of an arctic crystal.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe had been sitting in this crouching manner for some time, when all\\r\\nat once I thought I would open my eyes; for when between sheets,\\r\\nwhether by day or by night, and whether asleep or awake, I have a way\\r\\nof always keeping my eyes shut, in order the more to concentrate the\\r\\nsnugness of being in bed.  Because no man can ever feel his own\\r\\nidentity aright except his eyes be closed; as if darkness were\\r\\nindeed the proper element of our essences, though light be more\\r\\ncongenial to our clayey part.  Upon opening my eyes then, and coming\\r\\nout of my own pleasant and self-created darkness into the imposed and\\r\\ncoarse outer gloom of the unilluminated twelve-o\\'clock-at-night, I\\r\\nexperienced a disagreeable revulsion.  Nor did I at all object to the\\r\\nhint from Queequeg that perhaps it were best to strike a light,\\r\\nseeing that we were so wide awake; and besides he felt a strong\\r\\ndesire to have a few quiet puffs from his Tomahawk.  Be it said, that\\r\\nthough I had felt such a strong repugnance to his smoking in the bed\\r\\nthe night before, yet see how elastic our stiff prejudices grow when\\r\\nlove once comes to bend them.  For now I liked nothing better than\\r\\nto have Queequeg smoking by me, even in bed, because he seemed to be\\r\\nfull of such serene household joy then.  I no more felt unduly\\r\\nconcerned for the landlord\\'s policy of insurance.  I was only alive\\r\\nto the condensed confidential comfortableness of sharing a pipe and a\\r\\nblanket with a real friend.  With our shaggy jackets drawn about our\\r\\nshoulders, we now passed the Tomahawk from one to the other, till\\r\\nslowly there grew over us a blue hanging tester of smoke, illuminated\\r\\nby the flame of the new-lit lamp.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhether it was that this undulating tester rolled the savage away to\\r\\nfar distant scenes, I know not, but he now spoke of his native\\r\\nisland; and, eager to hear his history, I begged him to go on and\\r\\ntell it.  He gladly complied.  Though at the time I but ill\\r\\ncomprehended not a few of his words, yet subsequent disclosures, when\\r\\nI had become more familiar with his broken phraseology, now enable me\\r\\nto present the whole story such as it may prove in the mere skeleton\\r\\nI give.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 12\\r\\n\\r\\nBiographical.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nQueequeg was a native of Rokovoko, an island far away to the West\\r\\nand South.  It is not down in any map; true places never are.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen a new-hatched savage running wild about his native woodlands in\\r\\na grass clout, followed by the nibbling goats, as if he were a green\\r\\nsapling; even then, in Queequeg\\'s ambitious soul, lurked a strong\\r\\ndesire to see something more of Christendom than a specimen whaler or\\r\\ntwo.  His father was a High Chief, a King; his uncle a High Priest;\\r\\nand on the maternal side he boasted aunts who were the wives of\\r\\nunconquerable warriors.  There was excellent blood in his\\r\\nveins--royal stuff; though sadly vitiated, I fear, by the cannibal\\r\\npropensity he nourished in his untutored youth.\\r\\n\\r\\nA Sag Harbor ship visited his father\\'s bay, and Queequeg sought a\\r\\npassage to Christian lands.  But the ship, having her full complement\\r\\nof seamen, spurned his suit; and not all the King his father\\'s\\r\\ninfluence could prevail.  But Queequeg vowed a vow.  Alone in his\\r\\ncanoe, he paddled off to a distant strait, which he knew the ship\\r\\nmust pass through when she quitted the island.  On one side was a\\r\\ncoral reef; on the other a low tongue of land, covered with mangrove\\r\\nthickets that grew out into the water.  Hiding his canoe, still\\r\\nafloat, among these thickets, with its prow seaward, he sat down in\\r\\nthe stern, paddle low in hand; and when the ship was gliding by, like\\r\\na flash he darted out; gained her side; with one backward dash of his\\r\\nfoot capsized and sank his canoe; climbed up the chains; and throwing\\r\\nhimself at full length upon the deck, grappled a ring-bolt there, and\\r\\nswore not to let it go, though hacked in pieces.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard; suspended a\\r\\ncutlass over his naked wrists; Queequeg was the son of a King, and\\r\\nQueequeg budged not.  Struck by his desperate dauntlessness, and his\\r\\nwild desire to visit Christendom, the captain at last relented, and\\r\\ntold him he might make himself at home.  But this fine young\\r\\nsavage--this sea Prince of Wales, never saw the Captain\\'s cabin.\\r\\nThey put him down among the sailors, and made a whaleman of him.  But\\r\\nlike Czar Peter content to toil in the shipyards of foreign cities,\\r\\nQueequeg disdained no seeming ignominy, if thereby he might happily\\r\\ngain the power of enlightening his untutored countrymen.  For at\\r\\nbottom--so he told me--he was actuated by a profound desire to learn\\r\\namong the Christians, the arts whereby to make his people still\\r\\nhappier than they were; and more than that, still better than they\\r\\nwere.  But, alas! the practices of whalemen soon convinced him that\\r\\neven Christians could be both miserable and wicked; infinitely more\\r\\nso, than all his father\\'s heathens.  Arrived at last in old Sag\\r\\nHarbor; and seeing what the sailors did there; and then going on to\\r\\nNantucket, and seeing how they spent their wages in that place also,\\r\\npoor Queequeg gave it up for lost.  Thought he, it\\'s a wicked world\\r\\nin all meridians; I\\'ll die a pagan.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd thus an old idolator at heart, he yet lived among these\\r\\nChristians, wore their clothes, and tried to talk their gibberish.\\r\\nHence the queer ways about him, though now some time from home.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy hints, I asked him whether he did not propose going back, and\\r\\nhaving a coronation; since he might now consider his father dead and\\r\\ngone, he being very old and feeble at the last accounts.  He answered\\r\\nno, not yet; and added that he was fearful Christianity, or rather\\r\\nChristians, had unfitted him for ascending the pure and undefiled\\r\\nthrone of thirty pagan Kings before him.  But by and by, he said, he\\r\\nwould return,--as soon as he felt himself baptized again.  For the\\r\\nnonce, however, he proposed to sail about, and sow his wild oats in\\r\\nall four oceans.  They had made a harpooneer of him, and that barbed\\r\\niron was in lieu of a sceptre now.\\r\\n\\r\\nI asked him what might be his immediate purpose, touching his future\\r\\nmovements.  He answered, to go to sea again, in his old vocation.\\r\\nUpon this, I told him that whaling was my own design, and informed\\r\\nhim of my intention to sail out of Nantucket, as being the most\\r\\npromising port for an adventurous whaleman to embark from.  He at\\r\\nonce resolved to accompany me to that island, ship aboard the same\\r\\nvessel, get into the same watch, the same boat, the same mess with\\r\\nme, in short to share my every hap; with both my hands in his, boldly\\r\\ndip into the Potluck of both worlds.  To all this I joyously\\r\\nassented; for besides the affection I now felt for Queequeg, he was\\r\\nan experienced harpooneer, and as such, could not fail to be of great\\r\\nusefulness to one, who, like me, was wholly ignorant of the mysteries\\r\\nof whaling, though well acquainted with the sea, as known to merchant\\r\\nseamen.\\r\\n\\r\\nHis story being ended with his pipe\\'s last dying puff, Queequeg\\r\\nembraced me, pressed his forehead against mine, and blowing out the\\r\\nlight, we rolled over from each other, this way and that, and very\\r\\nsoon were sleeping.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 13\\r\\n\\r\\nWheelbarrow.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNext morning, Monday, after disposing of the embalmed head to a\\r\\nbarber, for a block, I settled my own and comrade\\'s bill; using,\\r\\nhowever, my comrade\\'s money.  The grinning landlord, as well as the\\r\\nboarders, seemed amazingly tickled at the sudden friendship which had\\r\\nsprung up between me and Queequeg--especially as Peter Coffin\\'s cock\\r\\nand bull stories about him had previously so much alarmed me\\r\\nconcerning the very person whom I now companied with.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe borrowed a wheelbarrow, and embarking our things, including my own\\r\\npoor carpet-bag, and Queequeg\\'s canvas sack and hammock, away we went\\r\\ndown to \"the Moss,\" the little Nantucket packet schooner moored at\\r\\nthe wharf.  As we were going along the people stared; not at Queequeg\\r\\nso much--for they were used to seeing cannibals like him in their\\r\\nstreets,--but at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms.  But\\r\\nwe heeded them not, going along wheeling the barrow by turns, and\\r\\nQueequeg now and then stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon\\r\\nbarbs.  I asked him why he carried such a troublesome thing with him\\r\\nashore, and whether all whaling ships did not find their own\\r\\nharpoons.  To this, in substance, he replied, that though what I\\r\\nhinted was true enough, yet he had a particular affection for his own\\r\\nharpoon, because it was of assured stuff, well tried in many a mortal\\r\\ncombat, and deeply intimate with the hearts of whales.  In short,\\r\\nlike many inland reapers and mowers, who go into the farmers\\' meadows\\r\\narmed with their own scythes--though in no wise obliged to furnish\\r\\nthem--even so, Queequeg, for his own private reasons, preferred his\\r\\nown harpoon.\\r\\n\\r\\nShifting the barrow from my hand to his, he told me a funny story\\r\\nabout the first wheelbarrow he had ever seen.  It was in Sag Harbor.\\r\\nThe owners of his ship, it seems, had lent him one, in which to carry\\r\\nhis heavy chest to his boarding house.  Not to seem ignorant about\\r\\nthe thing--though in truth he was entirely so, concerning the precise\\r\\nway in which to manage the barrow--Queequeg puts his chest upon it;\\r\\nlashes it fast; and then shoulders the barrow and marches up the\\r\\nwharf.  \"Why,\" said I, \"Queequeg, you might have known better than\\r\\nthat, one would think.  Didn\\'t the people laugh?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon this, he told me another story.  The people of his island of\\r\\nRokovoko, it seems, at their wedding feasts express the fragrant\\r\\nwater of young cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like a\\r\\npunchbowl; and this punchbowl always forms the great central ornament\\r\\non the braided mat where the feast is held.  Now a certain grand\\r\\nmerchant ship once touched at Rokovoko, and its commander--from all\\r\\naccounts, a very stately punctilious gentleman, at least for a sea\\r\\ncaptain--this commander was invited to the wedding feast of\\r\\nQueequeg\\'s sister, a pretty young princess just turned of ten.  Well;\\r\\nwhen all the wedding guests were assembled at the bride\\'s bamboo\\r\\ncottage, this Captain marches in, and being assigned the post of\\r\\nhonour, placed himself over against the punchbowl, and between the\\r\\nHigh Priest and his majesty the King, Queequeg\\'s father.  Grace being\\r\\nsaid,--for those people have their grace as well as we--though\\r\\nQueequeg told me that unlike us, who at such times look downwards to\\r\\nour platters, they, on the contrary, copying the ducks, glance\\r\\nupwards to the great Giver of all feasts--Grace, I say, being said,\\r\\nthe High Priest opens the banquet by the immemorial ceremony of the\\r\\nisland; that is, dipping his consecrated and consecrating fingers\\r\\ninto the bowl before the blessed beverage circulates.  Seeing himself\\r\\nplaced next the Priest, and noting the ceremony, and thinking\\r\\nhimself--being Captain of a ship--as having plain precedence over a\\r\\nmere island King, especially in the King\\'s own house--the Captain\\r\\ncoolly proceeds to wash his hands in the punchbowl;--taking it I\\r\\nsuppose for a huge finger-glass.  \"Now,\" said Queequeg, \"what you\\r\\ntink now?--Didn\\'t our people laugh?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAt last, passage paid, and luggage safe, we stood on board the\\r\\nschooner.  Hoisting sail, it glided down the Acushnet river.  On one\\r\\nside, New Bedford rose in terraces of streets, their ice-covered\\r\\ntrees all glittering in the clear, cold air.  Huge hills and\\r\\nmountains of casks on casks were piled upon her wharves, and side by\\r\\nside the world-wandering whale ships lay silent and safely moored at\\r\\nlast; while from others came a sound of carpenters and coopers, with\\r\\nblended noises of fires and forges to melt the pitch, all betokening\\r\\nthat new cruises were on the start; that one most perilous and long\\r\\nvoyage ended, only begins a second; and a second ended, only begins a\\r\\nthird, and so on, for ever and for aye.  Such is the endlessness,\\r\\nyea, the intolerableness of all earthly effort.\\r\\n\\r\\nGaining the more open water, the bracing breeze waxed fresh; the\\r\\nlittle Moss tossed the quick foam from her bows, as a young colt his\\r\\nsnortings.  How I snuffed that Tartar air!--how I spurned that\\r\\nturnpike earth!--that common highway all over dented with the marks\\r\\nof slavish heels and hoofs; and turned me to admire the magnanimity\\r\\nof the sea which will permit no records.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the same foam-fountain, Queequeg seemed to drink and reel with me.\\r\\nHis dusky nostrils swelled apart; he showed his filed and pointed\\r\\nteeth.  On, on we flew; and our offing gained, the Moss did homage to\\r\\nthe blast; ducked and dived her bows as a slave before the Sultan.\\r\\nSideways leaning, we sideways darted; every ropeyarn tingling like a\\r\\nwire; the two tall masts buckling like Indian canes in land\\r\\ntornadoes.  So full of this reeling scene were we, as we stood by the\\r\\nplunging bowsprit, that for some time we did not notice the jeering\\r\\nglances of the passengers, a lubber-like assembly, who marvelled that\\r\\ntwo fellow beings should be so companionable; as though a white man\\r\\nwere anything more dignified than a whitewashed negro.  But there\\r\\nwere some boobies and bumpkins there, who, by their intense\\r\\ngreenness, must have come from the heart and centre of all verdure.\\r\\nQueequeg caught one of these young saplings mimicking him behind his\\r\\nback.  I thought the bumpkin\\'s hour of doom was come.  Dropping his\\r\\nharpoon, the brawny savage caught him in his arms, and by an almost\\r\\nmiraculous dexterity and strength, sent him high up bodily into the\\r\\nair; then slightly tapping his stern in mid-somerset, the fellow\\r\\nlanded with bursting lungs upon his feet, while Queequeg, turning his\\r\\nback upon him, lighted his tomahawk pipe and passed it to me for a\\r\\npuff.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Capting!  Capting! yelled the bumpkin, running towards that officer;\\r\\n\"Capting, Capting, here\\'s the devil.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hallo, YOU sir,\" cried the Captain, a gaunt rib of the sea, stalking\\r\\nup to Queequeg, \"what in thunder do you mean by that?  Don\\'t you know\\r\\nyou might have killed that chap?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What him say?\" said Queequeg, as he mildly turned to me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He say,\" said I, \"that you came near kill-e that man there,\"\\r\\npointing to the still shivering greenhorn.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Kill-e,\" cried Queequeg, twisting his tattooed face into an\\r\\nunearthly expression of disdain, \"ah! him bevy small-e fish-e;\\r\\nQueequeg no kill-e so small-e fish-e; Queequeg kill-e big whale!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Look you,\" roared the Captain, \"I\\'ll kill-e YOU, you cannibal, if\\r\\nyou try any more of your tricks aboard here; so mind your eye.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut it so happened just then, that it was high time for the Captain\\r\\nto mind his own eye.  The prodigious strain upon the main-sail had\\r\\nparted the weather-sheet, and the tremendous boom was now flying from\\r\\nside to side, completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck.\\r\\nThe poor fellow whom Queequeg had handled so roughly, was swept\\r\\noverboard; all hands were in a panic; and to attempt snatching at the\\r\\nboom to stay it, seemed madness.  It flew from right to left, and\\r\\nback again, almost in one ticking of a watch, and every instant\\r\\nseemed on the point of snapping into splinters.  Nothing was done,\\r\\nand nothing seemed capable of being done; those on deck rushed\\r\\ntowards the bows, and stood eyeing the boom as if it were the lower\\r\\njaw of an exasperated whale.  In the midst of this consternation,\\r\\nQueequeg dropped deftly to his knees, and crawling under the path of\\r\\nthe boom, whipped hold of a rope, secured one end to the bulwarks,\\r\\nand then flinging the other like a lasso, caught it round the boom as\\r\\nit swept over his head, and at the next jerk, the spar was that way\\r\\ntrapped, and all was safe.  The schooner was run into the wind, and\\r\\nwhile the hands were clearing away the stern boat, Queequeg, stripped\\r\\nto the waist, darted from the side with a long living arc of a leap.\\r\\nFor three minutes or more he was seen swimming like a dog, throwing\\r\\nhis long arms straight out before him, and by turns revealing his\\r\\nbrawny shoulders through the freezing foam.  I looked at the grand\\r\\nand glorious fellow, but saw no one to be saved.  The greenhorn had\\r\\ngone down.  Shooting himself perpendicularly from the water,\\r\\nQueequeg, now took an instant\\'s glance around him, and seeming to see\\r\\njust how matters were, dived down and disappeared.  A few minutes\\r\\nmore, and he rose again, one arm still striking out, and with the\\r\\nother dragging a lifeless form.  The boat soon picked them up.  The\\r\\npoor bumpkin was restored.  All hands voted Queequeg a noble trump;\\r\\nthe captain begged his pardon.  From that hour I clove to Queequeg\\r\\nlike a barnacle; yea, till poor Queequeg took his last long dive.\\r\\n\\r\\nWas there ever such unconsciousness?  He did not seem to think that\\r\\nhe at all deserved a medal from the Humane and Magnanimous Societies.\\r\\nHe only asked for water--fresh water--something to wipe the brine\\r\\noff; that done, he put on dry clothes, lighted his pipe, and leaning\\r\\nagainst the bulwarks, and mildly eyeing those around him, seemed to\\r\\nbe saying to himself--\"It\\'s a mutual, joint-stock world, in all\\r\\nmeridians.  We cannibals must help these Christians.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 14\\r\\n\\r\\nNantucket.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNothing more happened on the passage worthy the mentioning; so, after\\r\\na fine run, we safely arrived in Nantucket.\\r\\n\\r\\nNantucket!  Take out your map and look at it.  See what a real corner\\r\\nof the world it occupies; how it stands there, away off shore, more\\r\\nlonely than the Eddystone lighthouse.  Look at it--a mere hillock,\\r\\nand elbow of sand; all beach, without a background.  There is more\\r\\nsand there than you would use in twenty years as a substitute for\\r\\nblotting paper.  Some gamesome wights will tell you that they have to\\r\\nplant weeds there, they don\\'t grow naturally; that they import Canada\\r\\nthistles; that they have to send beyond seas for a spile to stop a\\r\\nleak in an oil cask; that pieces of wood in Nantucket are carried\\r\\nabout like bits of the true cross in Rome; that people there plant\\r\\ntoadstools before their houses, to get under the shade in summer\\r\\ntime; that one blade of grass makes an oasis, three blades in a day\\'s\\r\\nwalk a prairie; that they wear quicksand shoes, something like\\r\\nLaplander snow-shoes; that they are so shut up, belted about, every\\r\\nway inclosed, surrounded, and made an utter island of by the ocean,\\r\\nthat to their very chairs and tables small clams will sometimes be\\r\\nfound adhering, as to the backs of sea turtles.  But these\\r\\nextravaganzas only show that Nantucket is no Illinois.\\r\\n\\r\\nLook now at the wondrous traditional story of how this island was\\r\\nsettled by the red-men.  Thus goes the legend.  In olden times an\\r\\neagle swooped down upon the New England coast, and carried off an\\r\\ninfant Indian in his talons.  With loud lament the parents saw their\\r\\nchild borne out of sight over the wide waters.  They resolved to\\r\\nfollow in the same direction.  Setting out in their canoes, after a\\r\\nperilous passage they discovered the island, and there they found an\\r\\nempty ivory casket,--the poor little Indian\\'s skeleton.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat wonder, then, that these Nantucketers, born on a beach, should\\r\\ntake to the sea for a livelihood!  They first caught crabs and\\r\\nquohogs in the sand; grown bolder, they waded out with nets for\\r\\nmackerel; more experienced, they pushed off in boats and captured\\r\\ncod; and at last, launching a navy of great ships on the sea,\\r\\nexplored this watery world; put an incessant belt of\\r\\ncircumnavigations round it; peeped in at Behring\\'s Straits; and in\\r\\nall seasons and all oceans declared everlasting war with the\\r\\nmightiest animated mass that has survived the flood; most monstrous\\r\\nand most mountainous!  That Himmalehan, salt-sea Mastodon, clothed\\r\\nwith such portentousness of unconscious power, that his very panics\\r\\nare more to be dreaded than his most fearless and malicious assaults!\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd thus have these naked Nantucketers, these sea hermits, issuing\\r\\nfrom their ant-hill in the sea, overrun and conquered the watery\\r\\nworld like so many Alexanders; parcelling out among them the\\r\\nAtlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans, as the three pirate powers did\\r\\nPoland.  Let America add Mexico to Texas, and pile Cuba upon Canada;\\r\\nlet the English overswarm all India, and hang out their blazing\\r\\nbanner from the sun; two thirds of this terraqueous globe are the\\r\\nNantucketer\\'s.  For the sea is his; he owns it, as Emperors own\\r\\nempires; other seamen having but a right of way through it.  Merchant\\r\\nships are but extension bridges; armed ones but floating forts; even\\r\\npirates and privateers, though following the sea as highwaymen the\\r\\nroad, they but plunder other ships, other fragments of the land like\\r\\nthemselves, without seeking to draw their living from the bottomless\\r\\ndeep itself.  The Nantucketer, he alone resides and riots on the sea;\\r\\nhe alone, in Bible language, goes down to it in ships; to and fro\\r\\nploughing it as his own special plantation.  THERE is his home; THERE\\r\\nlies his business, which a Noah\\'s flood would not interrupt, though\\r\\nit overwhelmed all the millions in China.  He lives on the sea, as\\r\\nprairie cocks in the prairie; he hides among the waves, he climbs\\r\\nthem as chamois hunters climb the Alps.  For years he knows not the\\r\\nland; so that when he comes to it at last, it smells like another\\r\\nworld, more strangely than the moon would to an Earthsman.  With the\\r\\nlandless gull, that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep\\r\\nbetween billows; so at nightfall, the Nantucketer, out of sight of\\r\\nland, furls his sails, and lays him to his rest, while under his very\\r\\npillow rush herds of walruses and whales.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 15\\r\\n\\r\\nChowder.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was quite late in the evening when the little Moss came snugly to\\r\\nanchor, and Queequeg and I went ashore; so we could attend to no\\r\\nbusiness that day, at least none but a supper and a bed.  The\\r\\nlandlord of the Spouter-Inn had recommended us to his cousin Hosea\\r\\nHussey of the Try Pots, whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one\\r\\nof the best kept hotels in all Nantucket, and moreover he had assured\\r\\nus that Cousin Hosea, as he called him, was famous for his chowders.\\r\\nIn short, he plainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than\\r\\ntry pot-luck at the Try Pots.  But the directions he had given us\\r\\nabout keeping a yellow warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened\\r\\na white church to the larboard, and then keeping that on the larboard\\r\\nhand till we made a corner three points to the starboard, and that\\r\\ndone, then ask the first man we met where the place was: these\\r\\ncrooked directions of his very much puzzled us at first, especially\\r\\nas, at the outset, Queequeg insisted that the yellow warehouse--our\\r\\nfirst point of departure--must be left on the larboard hand, whereas\\r\\nI had understood Peter Coffin to say it was on the starboard.\\r\\nHowever, by dint of beating about a little in the dark, and now and\\r\\nthen knocking up a peaceable inhabitant to inquire the way, we at\\r\\nlast came to something which there was no mistaking.\\r\\n\\r\\nTwo enormous wooden pots painted black, and suspended by asses\\' ears,\\r\\nswung from the cross-trees of an old top-mast, planted in front of an\\r\\nold doorway.  The horns of the cross-trees were sawed off on the\\r\\nother side, so that this old top-mast looked not a little like a\\r\\ngallows.  Perhaps I was over sensitive to such impressions at the\\r\\ntime, but I could not help staring at this gallows with a vague\\r\\nmisgiving.  A sort of crick was in my neck as I gazed up to the two\\r\\nremaining horns; yes, TWO of them, one for Queequeg, and one for me.\\r\\nIt\\'s ominous, thinks I.  A Coffin my Innkeeper upon landing in my\\r\\nfirst whaling port; tombstones staring at me in the whalemen\\'s\\r\\nchapel; and here a gallows! and a pair of prodigious black pots too!\\r\\nAre these last throwing out oblique hints touching Tophet?\\r\\n\\r\\nI was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman\\r\\nwith yellow hair and a yellow gown, standing in the porch of the inn,\\r\\nunder a dull red lamp swinging there, that looked much like an\\r\\ninjured eye, and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple\\r\\nwoollen shirt.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Get along with ye,\" said she to the man, \"or I\\'ll be combing ye!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come on, Queequeg,\" said I, \"all right.  There\\'s Mrs. Hussey.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so it turned out; Mr. Hosea Hussey being from home, but leaving\\r\\nMrs. Hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairs.  Upon\\r\\nmaking known our desires for a supper and a bed, Mrs. Hussey,\\r\\npostponing further scolding for the present, ushered us into a little\\r\\nroom, and seating us at a table spread with the relics of a recently\\r\\nconcluded repast, turned round to us and said--\"Clam or Cod?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s that about Cods, ma\\'am?\" said I, with much politeness.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Clam or Cod?\" she repeated.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"A clam for supper? a cold clam; is THAT what you mean, Mrs. Hussey?\"\\r\\nsays I, \"but that\\'s a rather cold and clammy reception in the winter\\r\\ntime, ain\\'t it, Mrs. Hussey?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple\\r\\nShirt, who was waiting for it in the entry, and seeming to hear\\r\\nnothing but the word \"clam,\" Mrs. Hussey hurried towards an open door\\r\\nleading to the kitchen, and bawling out \"clam for two,\" disappeared.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Queequeg,\" said I, \"do you think that we can make out a supper for\\r\\nus both on one clam?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the\\r\\napparently cheerless prospect before us.  But when that smoking\\r\\nchowder came in, the mystery was delightfully explained.  Oh, sweet\\r\\nfriends! hearken to me.  It was made of small juicy clams, scarcely\\r\\nbigger than hazel nuts, mixed with pounded ship biscuit, and salted\\r\\npork cut up into little flakes; the whole enriched with butter, and\\r\\nplentifully seasoned with pepper and salt.  Our appetites being\\r\\nsharpened by the frosty voyage, and in particular, Queequeg seeing\\r\\nhis favourite fishing food before him, and the chowder being\\r\\nsurpassingly excellent, we despatched it with great expedition: when\\r\\nleaning back a moment and bethinking me of Mrs. Hussey\\'s clam and cod\\r\\nannouncement, I thought I would try a little experiment.  Stepping to\\r\\nthe kitchen door, I uttered the word \"cod\" with great emphasis, and\\r\\nresumed my seat.  In a few moments the savoury steam came forth\\r\\nagain, but with a different flavor, and in good time a fine\\r\\ncod-chowder was placed before us.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe resumed business; and while plying our spoons in the bowl, thinks\\r\\nI to myself, I wonder now if this here has any effect on the head?\\r\\nWhat\\'s that stultifying saying about chowder-headed people?  \"But\\r\\nlook, Queequeg, ain\\'t that a live eel in your bowl?  Where\\'s your\\r\\nharpoon?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFishiest of all fishy places was the Try Pots, which well deserved\\r\\nits name; for the pots there were always boiling chowders.  Chowder\\r\\nfor breakfast, and chowder for dinner, and chowder for supper, till\\r\\nyou began to look for fish-bones coming through your clothes.  The\\r\\narea before the house was paved with clam-shells.  Mrs. Hussey wore a\\r\\npolished necklace of codfish vertebra; and Hosea Hussey had his\\r\\naccount books bound in superior old shark-skin.  There was a fishy\\r\\nflavor to the milk, too, which I could not at all account for, till\\r\\none morning happening to take a stroll along the beach among some\\r\\nfishermen\\'s boats, I saw Hosea\\'s brindled cow feeding on fish\\r\\nremnants, and marching along the sand with each foot in a cod\\'s\\r\\ndecapitated head, looking very slip-shod, I assure ye.\\r\\n\\r\\nSupper concluded, we received a lamp, and directions from Mrs. Hussey\\r\\nconcerning the nearest way to bed; but, as Queequeg was about to\\r\\nprecede me up the stairs, the lady reached forth her arm, and\\r\\ndemanded his harpoon; she allowed no harpoon in her chambers.  \"Why\\r\\nnot? said I; \"every true whaleman sleeps with his harpoon--but why\\r\\nnot?\"  \"Because it\\'s dangerous,\" says she.  \"Ever since young Stiggs\\r\\ncoming from that unfort\\'nt v\\'y\\'ge of his, when he was gone four years\\r\\nand a half, with only three barrels of ILE, was found dead in my\\r\\nfirst floor back, with his harpoon in his side; ever since then I\\r\\nallow no boarders to take sich dangerous weepons in their rooms at\\r\\nnight.  So, Mr. Queequeg\" (for she had learned his name), \"I will\\r\\njust take this here iron, and keep it for you till morning.  But the\\r\\nchowder; clam or cod to-morrow for breakfast, men?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Both,\" says I; \"and let\\'s have a couple of smoked herring by way of\\r\\nvariety.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 16\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ship.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn bed we concocted our plans for the morrow.  But to my surprise and\\r\\nno small concern, Queequeg now gave me to understand, that he had\\r\\nbeen diligently consulting Yojo--the name of his black little\\r\\ngod--and Yojo had told him two or three times over, and strongly\\r\\ninsisted upon it everyway, that instead of our going together among\\r\\nthe whaling-fleet in harbor, and in concert selecting our craft;\\r\\ninstead of this, I say, Yojo earnestly enjoined that the selection of\\r\\nthe ship should rest wholly with me, inasmuch as Yojo purposed\\r\\nbefriending us; and, in order to do so, had already pitched upon a\\r\\nvessel, which, if left to myself, I, Ishmael, should infallibly light\\r\\nupon, for all the world as though it had turned out by chance; and in\\r\\nthat vessel I must immediately ship myself, for the present\\r\\nirrespective of Queequeg.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have forgotten to mention that, in many things, Queequeg placed\\r\\ngreat confidence in the excellence of Yojo\\'s judgment and surprising\\r\\nforecast of things; and cherished Yojo with considerable esteem, as a\\r\\nrather good sort of god, who perhaps meant well enough upon the\\r\\nwhole, but in all cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, this plan of Queequeg\\'s, or rather Yojo\\'s, touching the\\r\\nselection of our craft; I did not like that plan at all.  I had not a\\r\\nlittle relied upon Queequeg\\'s sagacity to point out the whaler best\\r\\nfitted to carry us and our fortunes securely.  But as all my\\r\\nremonstrances produced no effect upon Queequeg, I was obliged to\\r\\nacquiesce; and accordingly prepared to set about this business with a\\r\\ndetermined rushing sort of energy and vigor, that should quickly\\r\\nsettle that trifling little affair.  Next morning early, leaving\\r\\nQueequeg shut up with Yojo in our little bedroom--for it seemed that\\r\\nit was some sort of Lent or Ramadan, or day of fasting, humiliation,\\r\\nand prayer with Queequeg and Yojo that day; HOW it was I never could\\r\\nfind out, for, though I applied myself to it several times, I never\\r\\ncould master his liturgies and XXXIX Articles--leaving Queequeg,\\r\\nthen, fasting on his tomahawk pipe, and Yojo warming himself at his\\r\\nsacrificial fire of shavings, I sallied out among the shipping.\\r\\nAfter much prolonged sauntering and many random inquiries, I learnt\\r\\nthat there were three ships up for three-years\\' voyages--The\\r\\nDevil-dam, the Tit-bit, and the Pequod.  DEVIL-DAM, I do not know\\r\\nthe origin of; TIT-BIT is obvious; PEQUOD, you will no doubt\\r\\nremember, was the name of a celebrated tribe of Massachusetts\\r\\nIndians; now extinct as the ancient Medes.  I peered and pryed about\\r\\nthe Devil-dam; from her, hopped over to the Tit-bit; and finally,\\r\\ngoing on board the Pequod, looked around her for a moment, and then\\r\\ndecided that this was the very ship for us.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou may have seen many a quaint craft in your day, for aught I\\r\\nknow;--square-toed luggers; mountainous Japanese junks; butter-box\\r\\ngalliots, and what not; but take my word for it, you never saw such a\\r\\nrare old craft as this same rare old Pequod.  She was a ship of the\\r\\nold school, rather small if anything; with an old-fashioned\\r\\nclaw-footed look about her.  Long seasoned and weather-stained in the\\r\\ntyphoons and calms of all four oceans, her old hull\\'s complexion was\\r\\ndarkened like a French grenadier\\'s, who has alike fought in Egypt and\\r\\nSiberia.  Her venerable bows looked bearded.  Her masts--cut\\r\\nsomewhere on the coast of Japan, where her original ones were lost\\r\\noverboard in a gale--her masts stood stiffly up like the spines of\\r\\nthe three old kings of Cologne.  Her ancient decks were worn and\\r\\nwrinkled, like the pilgrim-worshipped flag-stone in Canterbury\\r\\nCathedral where Becket bled.  But to all these her old antiquities,\\r\\nwere added new and marvellous features, pertaining to the wild\\r\\nbusiness that for more than half a century she had followed.  Old\\r\\nCaptain Peleg, many years her chief-mate, before he commanded another\\r\\nvessel of his own, and now a retired seaman, and one of the principal\\r\\nowners of the Pequod,--this old Peleg, during the term of his\\r\\nchief-mateship, had built upon her original grotesqueness, and inlaid\\r\\nit, all over, with a quaintness both of material and device,\\r\\nunmatched by anything except it be Thorkill-Hake\\'s carved buckler or\\r\\nbedstead.  She was apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian emperor,\\r\\nhis neck heavy with pendants of polished ivory.  She was a thing of\\r\\ntrophies.  A cannibal of a craft, tricking herself forth in the\\r\\nchased bones of her enemies.  All round, her unpanelled, open\\r\\nbulwarks were garnished like one continuous jaw, with the long sharp\\r\\nteeth of the sperm whale, inserted there for pins, to fasten her old\\r\\nhempen thews and tendons to.  Those thews ran not through base blocks\\r\\nof land wood, but deftly travelled over sheaves of sea-ivory.\\r\\nScorning a turnstile wheel at her reverend helm, she sported there a\\r\\ntiller; and that tiller was in one mass, curiously carved from the\\r\\nlong narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe.  The helmsman who\\r\\nsteered by that tiller in a tempest, felt like the Tartar, when he\\r\\nholds back his fiery steed by clutching its jaw.  A noble craft, but\\r\\nsomehow a most melancholy!  All noble things are touched with that.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow when I looked about the quarter-deck, for some one having\\r\\nauthority, in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage,\\r\\nat first I saw nobody; but I could not well overlook a strange sort\\r\\nof tent, or rather wigwam, pitched a little behind the main-mast.  It\\r\\nseemed only a temporary erection used in port.  It was of a conical\\r\\nshape, some ten feet high; consisting of the long, huge slabs of\\r\\nlimber black bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaws\\r\\nof the right-whale.  Planted with their broad ends on the deck, a\\r\\ncircle of these slabs laced together, mutually sloped towards each\\r\\nother, and at the apex united in a tufted point, where the loose\\r\\nhairy fibres waved to and fro like the top-knot on some old\\r\\nPottowottamie Sachem\\'s head.  A triangular opening faced towards the\\r\\nbows of the ship, so that the insider commanded a complete view\\r\\nforward.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd half concealed in this queer tenement, I at length found one who\\r\\nby his aspect seemed to have authority; and who, it being noon, and\\r\\nthe ship\\'s work suspended, was now enjoying respite from the burden\\r\\nof command.  He was seated on an old-fashioned oaken chair, wriggling\\r\\nall over with curious carving; and the bottom of which was formed of\\r\\na stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was\\r\\nconstructed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was nothing so very particular, perhaps, about the appearance\\r\\nof the elderly man I saw; he was brown and brawny, like most old\\r\\nseamen, and heavily rolled up in blue pilot-cloth, cut in the Quaker\\r\\nstyle; only there was a fine and almost microscopic net-work of the\\r\\nminutest wrinkles interlacing round his eyes, which must have arisen\\r\\nfrom his continual sailings in many hard gales, and always looking to\\r\\nwindward;--for this causes the muscles about the eyes to become\\r\\npursed together.  Such eye-wrinkles are very effectual in a scowl.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Is this the Captain of the Pequod?\" said I, advancing to the door of\\r\\nthe tent.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Supposing it be the captain of the Pequod, what dost thou want of\\r\\nhim?\" he demanded.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I was thinking of shipping.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou wast, wast thou?  I see thou art no Nantucketer--ever been in\\r\\na stove boat?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No, Sir, I never have.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dost know nothing at all about whaling, I dare say--eh?\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Nothing, Sir; but I have no doubt I shall soon learn.  I\\'ve been\\r\\nseveral voyages in the merchant service, and I think that--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Merchant service be damned.  Talk not that lingo to me.  Dost see\\r\\nthat leg?--I\\'ll take that leg away from thy stern, if ever thou\\r\\ntalkest of the marchant service to me again.  Marchant service\\r\\nindeed!  I suppose now ye feel considerable proud of having served in\\r\\nthose marchant ships.  But flukes! man, what makes thee want to go a\\r\\nwhaling, eh?--it looks a little suspicious, don\\'t it, eh?--Hast not\\r\\nbeen a pirate, hast thou?--Didst not rob thy last Captain, didst\\r\\nthou?--Dost not think of murdering the officers when thou gettest to\\r\\nsea?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI protested my innocence of these things.  I saw that under the mask\\r\\nof these half humorous innuendoes, this old seaman, as an insulated\\r\\nQuakerish Nantucketer, was full of his insular prejudices, and rather\\r\\ndistrustful of all aliens, unless they hailed from Cape Cod or the\\r\\nVineyard.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But what takes thee a-whaling?  I want to know that before I think\\r\\nof shipping ye.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, sir, I want to see what whaling is.  I want to see the world.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Want to see what whaling is, eh?  Have ye clapped eye on Captain\\r\\nAhab?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Who is Captain Ahab, sir?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Aye, aye, I thought so.  Captain Ahab is the Captain of this ship.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am mistaken then.  I thought I was speaking to the Captain\\r\\nhimself.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou art speaking to Captain Peleg--that\\'s who ye are speaking to,\\r\\nyoung man.  It belongs to me and Captain Bildad to see the Pequod\\r\\nfitted out for the voyage, and supplied with all her needs, including\\r\\ncrew.  We are part owners and agents.  But as I was going to say, if\\r\\nthou wantest to know what whaling is, as thou tellest ye do, I can\\r\\nput ye in a way of finding it out before ye bind yourself to it, past\\r\\nbacking out.  Clap eye on Captain Ahab, young man, and thou wilt find\\r\\nthat he has only one leg.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do you mean, sir?  Was the other one lost by a whale?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Lost by a whale!  Young man, come nearer to me: it was devoured,\\r\\nchewed up, crunched by the monstrousest parmacetty that ever chipped\\r\\na boat!--ah, ah!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI was a little alarmed by his energy, perhaps also a little touched\\r\\nat the hearty grief in his concluding exclamation, but said as calmly\\r\\nas I could, \"What you say is no doubt true enough, sir; but how could\\r\\nI know there was any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale,\\r\\nthough indeed I might have inferred as much from the simple fact of\\r\\nthe accident.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Look ye now, young man, thy lungs are a sort of soft, d\\'ye see; thou\\r\\ndost not talk shark a bit.  SURE, ye\\'ve been to sea before now; sure\\r\\nof that?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Sir,\" said I, \"I thought I told you that I had been four voyages in\\r\\nthe merchant--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Hard down out of that!  Mind what I said about the marchant\\r\\nservice--don\\'t aggravate me--I won\\'t have it.  But let us understand\\r\\neach other.  I have given thee a hint about what whaling is; do ye\\r\\nyet feel inclined for it?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I do, sir.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Very good.  Now, art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live\\r\\nwhale\\'s throat, and then jump after it?  Answer, quick!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am, sir, if it should be positively indispensable to do so; not to\\r\\nbe got rid of, that is; which I don\\'t take to be the fact.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Good again.  Now then, thou not only wantest to go a-whaling, to\\r\\nfind out by experience what whaling is, but ye also want to go in\\r\\norder to see the world?  Was not that what ye said?  I thought so.\\r\\nWell then, just step forward there, and take a peep over the\\r\\nweather-bow, and then back to me and tell me what ye see there.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a moment I stood a little puzzled by this curious request, not\\r\\nknowing exactly how to take it, whether humorously or in earnest.\\r\\nBut concentrating all his crow\\'s feet into one scowl, Captain Peleg\\r\\nstarted me on the errand.\\r\\n\\r\\nGoing forward and glancing over the weather bow, I perceived that the\\r\\nship swinging to her anchor with the flood-tide, was now obliquely\\r\\npointing towards the open ocean.  The prospect was unlimited, but\\r\\nexceedingly monotonous and forbidding; not the slightest variety that\\r\\nI could see.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, what\\'s the report?\" said Peleg when I came back; \"what did ye\\r\\nsee?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Not much,\" I replied--\"nothing but water; considerable horizon\\r\\nthough, and there\\'s a squall coming up, I think.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, what does thou think then of seeing the world?  Do ye wish to\\r\\ngo round Cape Horn to see any more of it, eh?  Can\\'t ye see the world\\r\\nwhere you stand?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI was a little staggered, but go a-whaling I must, and I would; and\\r\\nthe Pequod was as good a ship as any--I thought the best--and all\\r\\nthis I now repeated to Peleg.  Seeing me so determined, he expressed\\r\\nhis willingness to ship me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And thou mayest as well sign the papers right off,\" he added--\"come\\r\\nalong with ye.\"  And so saying, he led the way below deck into the\\r\\ncabin.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and\\r\\nsurprising figure.  It turned out to be Captain Bildad, who along\\r\\nwith Captain Peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel; the\\r\\nother shares, as is sometimes the case in these ports, being held by\\r\\na crowd of old annuitants; widows, fatherless children, and chancery\\r\\nwards; each owning about the value of a timber head, or a foot of\\r\\nplank, or a nail or two in the ship.  People in Nantucket invest\\r\\ntheir money in whaling vessels, the same way that you do yours in\\r\\napproved state stocks bringing in good interest.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, Bildad, like Peleg, and indeed many other Nantucketers, was a\\r\\nQuaker, the island having been originally settled by that sect; and\\r\\nto this day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure\\r\\nthe peculiarities of the Quaker, only variously and anomalously\\r\\nmodified by things altogether alien and heterogeneous.  For some of\\r\\nthese same Quakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and\\r\\nwhale-hunters.  They are fighting Quakers; they are Quakers with a\\r\\nvengeance.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo that there are instances among them of men, who, named with\\r\\nScripture names--a singularly common fashion on the island--and in\\r\\nchildhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of\\r\\nthe Quaker idiom; still, from the audacious, daring, and boundless\\r\\nadventure of their subsequent lives, strangely blend with these\\r\\nunoutgrown peculiarities, a thousand bold dashes of character, not\\r\\nunworthy a Scandinavian sea-king, or a poetical Pagan Roman.  And\\r\\nwhen these things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force,\\r\\nwith a globular brain and a ponderous heart; who has also by the\\r\\nstillness and seclusion of many long night-watches in the remotest\\r\\nwaters, and beneath constellations never seen here at the north, been\\r\\nled to think untraditionally and independently; receiving all\\r\\nnature\\'s sweet or savage impressions fresh from her own virgin\\r\\nvoluntary and confiding breast, and thereby chiefly, but with some\\r\\nhelp from accidental advantages, to learn a bold and nervous lofty\\r\\nlanguage--that man makes one in a whole nation\\'s census--a mighty\\r\\npageant creature, formed for noble tragedies.  Nor will it at all\\r\\ndetract from him, dramatically regarded, if either by birth or other\\r\\ncircumstances, he have what seems a half wilful overruling morbidness\\r\\nat the bottom of his nature.  For all men tragically great are made\\r\\nso through a certain morbidness.  Be sure of this, O young ambition,\\r\\nall mortal greatness is but disease.  But, as yet we have not to do\\r\\nwith such an one, but with quite another; and still a man, who, if\\r\\nindeed peculiar, it only results again from another phase of the\\r\\nQuaker, modified by individual circumstances.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike Captain Peleg, Captain Bildad was a well-to-do, retired\\r\\nwhaleman.  But unlike Captain Peleg--who cared not a rush for what\\r\\nare called serious things, and indeed deemed those self-same serious\\r\\nthings the veriest of all trifles--Captain Bildad had not only been\\r\\noriginally educated according to the strictest sect of Nantucket\\r\\nQuakerism, but all his subsequent ocean life, and the sight of many\\r\\nunclad, lovely island creatures, round the Horn--all that had not\\r\\nmoved this native born Quaker one single jot, had not so much as\\r\\naltered one angle of his vest.  Still, for all this immutableness,\\r\\nwas there some lack of common consistency about worthy Captain\\r\\nPeleg.  Though refusing, from conscientious scruples, to bear arms\\r\\nagainst land invaders, yet himself had illimitably invaded the\\r\\nAtlantic and Pacific; and though a sworn foe to human bloodshed, yet\\r\\nhad he in his straight-bodied coat, spilled tuns upon tuns of\\r\\nleviathan gore.  How now in the contemplative evening of his days,\\r\\nthe pious Bildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence, I do\\r\\nnot know; but it did not seem to concern him much, and very probably\\r\\nhe had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a\\r\\nman\\'s religion is one thing, and this practical world quite another.\\r\\nThis world pays dividends.  Rising from a little cabin-boy in short\\r\\nclothes of the drabbest drab, to a harpooneer in a broad shad-bellied\\r\\nwaistcoat; from that becoming boat-header, chief-mate, and captain,\\r\\nand finally a ship owner; Bildad, as I hinted before, had concluded\\r\\nhis adventurous career by wholly retiring from active life at the\\r\\ngoodly age of sixty, and dedicating his remaining days to the quiet\\r\\nreceiving of his well-earned income.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, Bildad, I am sorry to say, had the reputation of being an\\r\\nincorrigible old hunks, and in his sea-going days, a bitter, hard\\r\\ntask-master.  They told me in Nantucket, though it certainly seems a\\r\\ncurious story, that when he sailed the old Categut whaleman, his\\r\\ncrew, upon arriving home, were mostly all carried ashore to the\\r\\nhospital, sore exhausted and worn out.  For a pious man, especially\\r\\nfor a Quaker, he was certainly rather hard-hearted, to say the\\r\\nleast.  He never used to swear, though, at his men, they said; but\\r\\nsomehow he got an inordinate quantity of cruel, unmitigated hard work\\r\\nout of them.  When Bildad was a chief-mate, to have his drab-coloured\\r\\neye intently looking at you, made you feel completely nervous, till\\r\\nyou could clutch something--a hammer or a marling-spike, and go to\\r\\nwork like mad, at something or other, never mind what.  Indolence and\\r\\nidleness perished before him.  His own person was the exact\\r\\nembodiment of his utilitarian character.  On his long, gaunt body, he\\r\\ncarried no spare flesh, no superfluous beard, his chin having a soft,\\r\\neconomical nap to it, like the worn nap of his broad-brimmed hat.\\r\\n\\r\\nSuch, then, was the person that I saw seated on the transom when I\\r\\nfollowed Captain Peleg down into the cabin.  The space between the\\r\\ndecks was small; and there, bolt-upright, sat old Bildad, who always\\r\\nsat so, and never leaned, and this to save his coat tails.  His\\r\\nbroad-brim was placed beside him; his legs were stiffly crossed; his\\r\\ndrab vesture was buttoned up to his chin; and spectacles on nose, he\\r\\nseemed absorbed in reading from a ponderous volume.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Bildad,\" cried Captain Peleg, \"at it again, Bildad, eh?  Ye have\\r\\nbeen studying those Scriptures, now, for the last thirty years, to my\\r\\ncertain knowledge.  How far ye got, Bildad?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate,\\r\\nBildad, without noticing his present irreverence, quietly looked up,\\r\\nand seeing me, glanced again inquiringly towards Peleg.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He says he\\'s our man, Bildad,\" said Peleg, \"he wants to ship.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Dost thee?\" said Bildad, in a hollow tone, and turning round to me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I dost,\" said I unconsciously, he was so intense a Quaker.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What do ye think of him, Bildad?\" said Peleg.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"He\\'ll do,\" said Bildad, eyeing me, and then went on spelling away at\\r\\nhis book in a mumbling tone quite audible.\\r\\n\\r\\nI thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever saw, especially as\\r\\nPeleg, his friend and old shipmate, seemed such a blusterer.  But I\\r\\nsaid nothing, only looking round me sharply.  Peleg now threw open a\\r\\nchest, and drawing forth the ship\\'s articles, placed pen and ink\\r\\nbefore him, and seated himself at a little table.  I began to think\\r\\nit was high time to settle with myself at what terms I would be\\r\\nwilling to engage for the voyage.  I was already aware that in the\\r\\nwhaling business they paid no wages; but all hands, including the\\r\\ncaptain, received certain shares of the profits called lays, and that\\r\\nthese lays were proportioned to the degree of importance pertaining\\r\\nto the respective duties of the ship\\'s company.  I was also aware\\r\\nthat being a green hand at whaling, my own lay would not be very\\r\\nlarge; but considering that I was used to the sea, could steer a\\r\\nship, splice a rope, and all that, I made no doubt that from all I\\r\\nhad heard I should be offered at least the 275th lay--that is, the\\r\\n275th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage, whatever that\\r\\nmight eventually amount to.  And though the 275th lay was what they\\r\\ncall a rather LONG LAY, yet it was better than nothing; and if we had\\r\\na lucky voyage, might pretty nearly pay for the clothing I would wear\\r\\nout on it, not to speak of my three years\\' beef and board, for which\\r\\nI would not have to pay one stiver.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely\\r\\nfortune--and so it was, a very poor way indeed.  But I am one of\\r\\nthose that never take on about princely fortunes, and am quite\\r\\ncontent if the world is ready to board and lodge me, while I am\\r\\nputting up at this grim sign of the Thunder Cloud.  Upon the whole, I\\r\\nthought that the 275th lay would be about the fair thing, but would not\\r\\nhave been surprised had I been offered the 200th, considering I was\\r\\nof a broad-shouldered make.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little distrustful about\\r\\nreceiving a generous share of the profits was this: Ashore, I had\\r\\nheard something of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old crony\\r\\nBildad; how that they being the principal proprietors of the Pequod,\\r\\ntherefore the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners,\\r\\nleft nearly the whole management of the ship\\'s affairs to these two.\\r\\nAnd I did not know but what the stingy old Bildad might have a mighty\\r\\ndeal to say about shipping hands, especially as I now found him on\\r\\nboard the Pequod, quite at home there in the cabin, and reading his\\r\\nBible as if at his own fireside.  Now while Peleg was vainly trying\\r\\nto mend a pen with his jack-knife, old Bildad, to my no small\\r\\nsurprise, considering that he was such an interested party in these\\r\\nproceedings; Bildad never heeded us, but went on mumbling to himself\\r\\nout of his book, \"LAY not up for yourselves treasures upon earth,\\r\\nwhere moth--\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, Captain Bildad,\" interrupted Peleg, \"what d\\'ye say, what lay\\r\\nshall we give this young man?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou knowest best,\" was the sepulchral reply, \"the seven hundred and\\r\\nseventy-seventh wouldn\\'t be too much, would it?--\\'where moth and rust\\r\\ndo corrupt, but LAY--\\'\"\\r\\n\\r\\nLAY, indeed, thought I, and such a lay! the seven hundred and\\r\\nseventy-seventh!  Well, old Bildad, you are determined that I, for\\r\\none, shall not LAY up many LAYS here below, where moth and rust do\\r\\ncorrupt.  It was an exceedingly LONG LAY that, indeed; and though\\r\\nfrom the magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a\\r\\nlandsman, yet the slightest consideration will show that though seven\\r\\nhundred and seventy-seven is a pretty large number, yet, when you\\r\\ncome to make a TEENTH of it, you will then see, I say, that the seven\\r\\nhundred and seventy-seventh part of a farthing is a good deal less\\r\\nthan seven hundred and seventy-seven gold doubloons; and so I thought\\r\\nat the time.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Why, blast your eyes, Bildad,\" cried Peleg, \"thou dost not want to\\r\\nswindle this young man! he must have more than that.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Seven hundred and seventy-seventh,\" again said Bildad, without\\r\\nlifting his eyes; and then went on mumbling--\"for where your treasure\\r\\nis, there will your heart be also.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"I am going to put him down for the three hundredth,\" said Peleg, \"do\\r\\nye hear that, Bildad!  The three hundredth lay, I say.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBildad laid down his book, and turning solemnly towards him said,\\r\\n\"Captain Peleg, thou hast a generous heart; but thou must consider\\r\\nthe duty thou owest to the other owners of this ship--widows and\\r\\norphans, many of them--and that if we too abundantly reward the\\r\\nlabors of this young man, we may be taking the bread from those\\r\\nwidows and those orphans.  The seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay,\\r\\nCaptain Peleg.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Thou Bildad!\" roared Peleg, starting up and clattering about the\\r\\ncabin.  \"Blast ye, Captain Bildad, if I had followed thy advice in\\r\\nthese matters, I would afore now had a conscience to lug about that\\r\\nwould be heavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed\\r\\nround Cape Horn.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Captain Peleg,\" said Bildad steadily, \"thy conscience may be drawing\\r\\nten inches of water, or ten fathoms, I can\\'t tell; but as thou art\\r\\nstill an impenitent man, Captain Peleg, I greatly fear lest thy\\r\\nconscience be but a leaky one; and will in the end sink thee\\r\\nfoundering down to the fiery pit, Captain Peleg.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Fiery pit! fiery pit! ye insult me, man; past all natural bearing,\\r\\nye insult me.  It\\'s an all-fired outrage to tell any human creature\\r\\nthat he\\'s bound to hell.  Flukes and flames!  Bildad, say that again\\r\\nto me, and start my soul-bolts, but I\\'ll--I\\'ll--yes, I\\'ll swallow a\\r\\nlive goat with all his hair and horns on.  Out of the cabin, ye\\r\\ncanting, drab-coloured son of a wooden gun--a straight wake with ye!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs he thundered out this he made a rush at Bildad, but with a\\r\\nmarvellous oblique, sliding celerity, Bildad for that time eluded\\r\\nhim.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and\\r\\nresponsible owners of the ship, and feeling half a mind to give up\\r\\nall idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily\\r\\ncommanded, I stepped aside from the door to give egress to Bildad,\\r\\nwho, I made no doubt, was all eagerness to vanish from before the\\r\\nawakened wrath of Peleg.  But to my astonishment, he sat down again\\r\\non the transom very quietly, and seemed to have not the slightest\\r\\nintention of withdrawing.  He seemed quite used to impenitent Peleg\\r\\nand his ways.  As for Peleg, after letting off his rage as he had,\\r\\nthere seemed no more left in him, and he, too, sat down like a lamb,\\r\\nthough he twitched a little as if still nervously agitated.  \"Whew!\"\\r\\nhe whistled at last--\"the squall\\'s gone off to leeward, I think.\\r\\nBildad, thou used to be good at sharpening a lance, mend that pen,\\r\\nwill ye.  My jack-knife here needs the grindstone.  That\\'s he; thank\\r\\nye, Bildad.  Now then, my young man, Ishmael\\'s thy name, didn\\'t ye\\r\\nsay?  Well then, down ye go here, Ishmael, for the three hundredth\\r\\nlay.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Captain Peleg,\" said I, \"I have a friend with me who wants to ship\\r\\ntoo--shall I bring him down to-morrow?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"To be sure,\" said Peleg.  \"Fetch him along, and we\\'ll look at him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What lay does he want?\" groaned Bildad, glancing up from the book\\r\\nin which he had again been burying himself.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Oh! never thee mind about that, Bildad,\" said Peleg.  \"Has he ever\\r\\nwhaled it any?\" turning to me.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Killed more whales than I can count, Captain Peleg.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Well, bring him along then.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, after signing the papers, off I went; nothing doubting but that\\r\\nI had done a good morning\\'s work, and that the Pequod was the\\r\\nidentical ship that Yojo had provided to carry Queequeg and me round\\r\\nthe Cape.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut I had not proceeded far, when I began to bethink me that the\\r\\nCaptain with whom I was to sail yet remained unseen by me; though,\\r\\nindeed, in many cases, a whale-ship will be completely fitted out,\\r\\nand receive all her crew on board, ere the captain makes himself\\r\\nvisible by arriving to take command; for sometimes these voyages are\\r\\nso prolonged, and the shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief,\\r\\nthat if the captain have a family, or any absorbing concernment of\\r\\nthat sort, he does not trouble himself much about his ship in port,\\r\\nbut leaves her to the owners till all is ready for sea.  However, it\\r\\nis always as well to have a look at him before irrevocably committing\\r\\nyourself into his hands.  Turning back I accosted Captain Peleg,\\r\\ninquiring where Captain Ahab was to be found.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And what dost thou want of Captain Ahab?  It\\'s all right enough;\\r\\nthou art shipped.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Yes, but I should like to see him.\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"But I don\\'t think thou wilt be able to at present.  I don\\'t know\\r\\nexactly what\\'s the matter with him; but he keeps close inside the\\r\\nhouse; a sort of sick, and yet he don\\'t look so.  In fact, he ain\\'t\\r\\nsick; but no, he isn\\'t well either.  Any how, young man, he won\\'t\\r\\nalways see me, so I don\\'t suppose he will thee.  He\\'s a queer man,\\r\\nCaptain Ahab--so some think--but a good one.  Oh, thou\\'lt like him\\r\\nwell enough; no fear, no fear.  He\\'s a grand, ungodly, god-like man,\\r\\nCaptain Ahab; doesn\\'t speak much; but, when he does speak, then you\\r\\nmay well listen.  Mark ye, be forewarned; Ahab\\'s above the common;\\r\\nAhab\\'s been in colleges, as well as \\'mong the cannibals; been used to\\r\\ndeeper wonders than the waves; fixed his fiery lance in mightier,\\r\\nstranger foes than whales.  His lance! aye, the keenest and the surest\\r\\nthat out of all our isle!  Oh! he ain\\'t Captain Bildad; no, and he\\r\\nain\\'t Captain Peleg; HE\\'S AHAB, boy; and Ahab of old, thou knowest,\\r\\nwas a crowned king!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"And a very vile one.  When that wicked king was slain, the dogs, did\\r\\nthey not lick his blood?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Come hither to me--hither, hither,\" said Peleg, with a significance\\r\\nin his eye that almost startled me.  \"Look ye, lad; never say that on\\r\\nboard the Pequod.  Never say it anywhere.  Captain Ahab did not name\\r\\nhimself.  \\'Twas a foolish, ignorant whim of his crazy, widowed\\r\\nmother, who died when he was only a twelvemonth old.  And yet the old\\r\\nsquaw Tistig, at Gayhead, said that the name would somehow prove\\r\\nprophetic.  And, perhaps, other fools like her may tell thee the\\r\\nsame.  I wish to warn thee.  It\\'s a lie.  I know Captain Ahab well;\\r\\nI\\'ve sailed with him as mate years ago; I know what he is--a good\\r\\nman--not a pious, good man, like Bildad, but a swearing good\\r\\nman--something like me--only there\\'s a good deal more of him.  Aye,\\r\\naye, I know that he was never very jolly; and I know that on the\\r\\npassage home, he was a little out of his mind for a spell; but it was\\r\\nthe sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump that brought that\\r\\nabout, as any one might see.  I know, too, that ever since he lost\\r\\nhis leg last voyage by that accursed whale, he\\'s been a kind of\\r\\nmoody--desperate moody, and savage sometimes; but that will all pass\\r\\noff.  And once for all, let me tell thee and assure thee, young man,\\r\\nit\\'s better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad\\r\\none.  So good-bye to thee--and wrong not Captain Ahab, because he\\r\\nhappens to have a wicked name.  Besides, my boy, he has a wife--not\\r\\nthree voyages wedded--a sweet, resigned girl.  Think of that; by that\\r\\nsweet girl that old man has a child: hold ye then there can be any\\r\\nutter, hopeless harm in Ahab?  No, no, my lad; stricken, blasted, if\\r\\nhe be, Ahab has his humanities!\"\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I walked away, I was full of thoughtfulness; what had been\\r\\nincidentally revealed to me of Captain Ahab, filled me with a certain\\r\\nwild vagueness of painfulness concerning him.  And somehow, at the\\r\\ntime, I felt a sympathy and a sorrow for him, but for I don\\'t know\\r\\nwhat, unless it was the cruel loss of his leg.  And yet I also felt a\\r\\nstrange awe of him; but that sort of awe, which I cannot at all\\r\\ndescribe, was not exactly awe; I do not know what it was.  But I felt\\r\\nit; and it did not disincline me towards him; though I felt\\r\\nimpatience at what seemed like mystery in him, so imperfectly as he\\r\\nwas known to me then.  However, my thoughts were at length carried in\\r\\nother directions, so that for the present dark Ahab slipped my mind.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCHAPTER 17\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Ramadan.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Queequeg\\'s Ramadan, or Fasting and Humiliation, was to continue\\r\\nall day, I did not choose to disturb him till towards night-fall; for\\r\\nI cherish the greatest respect towards everybody\\'s religious\\r\\nobligations, never mind how comical, and could not find it in my\\r\\nheart to undervalue even a congregation of ants worshipping a\\r\\ntoad-stool; or those other creatures in certain parts of our earth,\\r\\nwho with a degree of footmanism quite unprecedented in other planets,\\r\\nbow down before the torso of a deceased landed proprietor merely on\\r\\naccount of the inordinate possessions yet owned and rented in his\\r\\nname.\\r\\n\\r\\nI say, we good Presbyterian Christians should be charitable in these\\r\\nthings, and not fancy ourselves so vastly superior to other mortals,\\r\\npagans and what not, because of their half-crazy conceits on these\\r\\nsubjects.  There was Queequeg, now, certainly entertaining the most\\r\\nabsurd notions about Yojo and his Ramadan;--but what of that?\\r\\nQueequeg thought he knew what he was about, I suppose; he seemed to\\r\\nbe content; and there let him rest.  All our arguing with him would\\r\\nnot avail; let him be, I say: and Heaven have mercy on us\\r\\nall--Presbyterians and Pagans alike--for we are all somehow\\r\\ndreadfully cracked about the head, and sadly need mending.\\r\\n\\r\\nTowards evening, when I felt assured that all his performances and\\r\\nrituals must be over, I went up to his room and knocked at the door;\\r\\nbut no answer.  I tried to open it, but it was fastened inside.\\r\\n\"Queequeg,\" said I softly through the key-hole:--all silent.  \"I say,\\r\\nQueequeg! why don\\'t you speak?  It\\'s I--Ishmael.\"  But all remained\\r\\nstill as before.  I began to grow alarmed.  I had allowed him such\\r\\nabundant time; I thought he might have had an apoplectic fit.  I\\r\\nlooked through the key-hole; but the door opening into an odd corner\\r\\nof the room, the key-hole prospect was but a crooked and sinister\\r\\none.  I could only see part of the foot-board of the bed and a line\\r\\nof the wall, but nothing more.  I was surprised to behold resting\\r\\nagainst the wall the wooden shaft of Queequeg\\'s harpoon, which the\\r\\nlandlady the evening previous had taken from him, before our mounting\\r\\nto the chamber.  That\\'s strange, thought I; but at any rate, since\\r\\nthe harpoon stands yonder, and he seldom or never goes abroad without\\r\\nit, therefore he must be inside here, and no possible mistake.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Queequeg!--Queequeg!\"--all still.  Something must have happened.\\r\\nApoplexy!  I tried to burst open the door; but it stubbornly\\r\\nresisted.  Running down stairs, I quickly stated my suspicions to the\\r\\nfirst person I met--the chamber-maid.  \"La! la!\" she cried, \"I\\r\\nthought something must be the matter.  I went to make the bed after\\r\\nbreakfast, and the door was locked; and not a mouse to be heard; and\\r\\nit\\'s been just so silent ever since.  But I thought, may be, you had\\r\\nboth gone off and locked your baggage in for safe keeping.  La! la,\\r\\nma\\'am!--Mistress! murder!  Mrs. Hussey! apoplexy!\"--and with these\\r\\ncries, she ran towards the kitchen, I following.\\r\\n\\r\\nMrs. Hussey soon appeared, with a mustard-pot in one hand and a\\r\\nvinegar-cruet in the other, having just broken away from the\\r\\noccupation of attending to the castors, and scolding her little black\\r\\nboy meantime.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Wood-house!\" cried I, \"which way to it?  Run for God\\'s sake, and\\r\\nfetch something to pry open the door--the axe!--the axe! he\\'s had a\\r\\nstroke; depend upon it!\"--and so saying I was unmethodically rushing\\r\\nup stairs again empty-handed, when Mrs. Hussey interposed the\\r\\nmustard-pot and vinegar-cruet, and the entire castor of her\\r\\ncountenance.\\r\\n\\r\\n\"What\\'s the matter with you, young man?\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Get the axe!  For God\\'s sake, run for the doctor, some one, while I\\r\\npry it open!\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\"Look here,\" said the landlady, quickly putting down the\\r\\nvinegar-cruet, so as to have one hand free; \"look here; are you\\r\\ntalking about prying open any of my doors?\"--and with that she seized\\r\\nmy arm.  \"What\\'s the matter with you?  What\\'s the matter with you,\\r\\nshipmate?\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIn as calm, but rapid a manner as possible, I gave her to understand\\r\\nthe whole case.  Unconsciously clapping the vinegar-cruet to one side\\r\\nof her nose, she ruminated for an instant; then exclaimed--\"No!  I\\r\\nhaven\\'t seen it sinc'"

       "' Call me Ishmael. Some years ago--never mind how long precisely--having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people\\'s hats off--then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me. There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs--commerce surrounds it with her surf. Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme downtown is the battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were out of sight of land. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there. Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall, northward. What do you see?--Posted like silent sentinels all around the town, stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some leaning against the spiles; some seated upon the pier-heads; some looking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some high aloft in the rigging, as if striving to get a still better seaward peep. But these are all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath and plaster--tied to counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is this? Are the green fields gone? What do they here? But look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and seemingly bound for a dive. Strange! Nothing will content them but the extremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder warehouses will not suffice. No. They must get just as nigh the water as they possibly can without falling in. And there they stand--miles of them--leagues. Inlanders all, they come from lanes and alleys, streets and avenues--north, east, south, and west. Yet here they all unite. Tell me, does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of all those ships attract them thither? Once more. Say you are in the country; in some high land of lakes. Take almost any path you please, and ten to one it carries you down in a dale, and leaves you there by a pool in the stream. There is magic in it. Let the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his deepest reveries--stand that man on his legs, set his feet a-going, and he will infallibly lead you to water, if water there be in all that region. Should you ever be athirst in the great American desert, try this experiment, if your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical professor. Yes, as every one knows, meditation and water are wedded for ever. But here is an artist. He desires to paint you the dreamiest, shadiest, quietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley of the Saco. What is the chief element he employs? There stand his trees, each with a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a crucifix were within; and here sleeps his meadow, and there sleep his cattle; and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke. Deep into distant woodlands winds a mazy way, reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in their hill-side blue. But though the picture lies thus tranced, and though this pine-tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this shepherd\\'s head, yet all were vain, unless the shepherd\\'s eye were fixed upon the magic stream before him. Go visit the Prairies in June, when for scores on scores of miles you wade knee-deep among Tiger-lilies--what is the one charm wanting?--Water--there is not a drop of water there! Were Niagara but a cataract of sand, would you travel your thousand miles to see it? Why did the poor poet of Tennessee, upon suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver, deliberate whether to buy him a coat, which he sadly needed, or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to Rockaway Beach? Why is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him, at some time or other crazy to go to sea? Why upon your first voyage as a passenger, did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration, when first told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land? Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy? Why did the Greeks give it a separate deity, and own brother of Jove? Surely all this is not without meaning. And still deeper the meaning of that story of Narcissus, who because he could not grasp the tormenting, mild image he saw in the fountain, plunged into it and was drowned. But that same image, we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans. It is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life; and this is the key to it all. Now, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I begin to grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of my lungs, I do not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as a passenger. For to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse, and a purse is but a rag unless you have something in it. Besides, passengers get sea-sick--grow quarrelsome--don\\'t sleep of nights--do not enjoy themselves much, as a general thing;--no, I never go as a passenger; nor, though I am something of a salt, do I ever go to sea as a Commodore, or a Captain, or a Cook. I abandon the glory and distinction of such offices to those who like them. For my part, I abominate all honourable respectable toils, trials, and tribulations of every kind whatsoever. It is quite as much as I can do to take care of myself, without taking care of ships, barques, brigs, schooners, and what not. And as for going as cook,--though I confess there is considerable glory in that, a cook being a sort of officer on ship-board--yet, somehow, I never fancied broiling fowls;--though once broiled, judiciously buttered, and judgmatically salted and peppered, there is no one who will speak more respectfully, not to say reverentially, of a broiled fowl than I will. It is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old Egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse, that you see the mummies of those creatures in their huge bake-houses the pyramids. No, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the mast, plumb down into the forecastle, aloft there to the royal mast-head. True, they rather order me about some, and make me jump from spar to spar, like a grasshopper in a May meadow. And at first, this sort of thing is unpleasant enough. It touches one\\'s sense of honour, particularly if you come of an old established family in the land, the Van Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes. And more than all, if just previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot, you have been lording it as a country schoolmaster, making the tallest boys stand in awe of you. The transition is a keen one, I assure you, from a schoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong decoction of Seneca and the Stoics to enable you to grin and bear it. But even this wears off in time. What of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a broom and sweep down the decks? What does that indignity amount to, weighed, I mean, in the scales of the New Testament? Do you think the archangel Gabriel thinks anything the less of me, because I promptly and respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance? Who ain\\'t a slave? Tell me that. Well, then, however the old sea-captains may order me about--however they may thump and punch me about, I have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right; that everybody else is one way or other served in much the same way--either in a physical or metaphysical point of view, that is; and so the universal thump is passed round, and all hands should rub each other\\'s shoulder-blades, and be content. Again, I always go to sea as a sailor, because they make a point of paying me for my trouble, whereas they never pay passengers a single penny that I ever heard of. On the contrary, passengers themselves must pay. And there is all the difference in the world between paying and being paid. The act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon us. But BEING PAID,--what will compare with it? The urbane activity with which a man receives money is really marvellous, considering that we so earnestly believe money to be the root of all earthly ills, and that on no account can a monied man enter heaven. Ah! how cheerfully we consign ourselves to perdition! Finally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the wholesome exercise and pure air of the fore-castle deck. For as in this world, head winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern (that is, if you never violate the Pythagorean maxim), so for the most part the Commodore on the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from the sailors on the forecastle. He thinks he breathes it first; but not so. In much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many other things, at the same time that the leaders little suspect it. But wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a merchant sailor, I should now take it into my head to go on a whaling voyage; this the invisible police officer of the Fates, who has the constant surveillance of me, and secretly dogs me, and influences me in some unaccountable way--he can better answer than any one else. And, doubtless, my going on this whaling voyage, formed part of the grand programme of Providence that was drawn up a long time ago. It came in as a sort of brief interlude and solo between more extensive performances. I take it that this part of the bill must have run something like this: \"GRAND CONTESTED ELECTION FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES. \"WHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL. \"BLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN.\" Though I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers, the Fates, put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage, when others were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies, and short and easy parts in genteel comedies, and jolly parts in farces--though I cannot tell why this was exactly; yet, now that I recall all the circumstances, I think I can see a little into the springs and motives which being cunningly presented to me under various disguises, induced me to set about performing the part I did, besides cajoling me into the delusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill and discriminating judgment. Chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great whale himself. Such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my curiosity. Then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island bulk; the undeliverable, nameless perils of the whale; these, with all the attending marvels of a thousand Patagonian sights and sounds, helped to sway me to my wish. With other men, perhaps, such things would not have been inducements; but as for me, I am tormented with an everlasting itch for things remote. I love to sail forbidden seas, and land on barbarous coasts. Not ignoring what is good, I am quick to perceive a horror, and could still be social with it--would they let me--since it is but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of the place one lodges in. By reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage was welcome; the great flood-gates of the wonder-world swung open, and in the wild conceits that swayed me to my purpose, two and two there floated into my inmost soul, endless processions of the whale, and, mid most of them all, one grand hooded phantom, like a snow hill in the air.

    "* Lowercasing\n",
    "* Stemming: Use patterns to remove prefixes and suffixes from words.\n",
    "* Lemmatiziation: Look up each token in a dictionary and replace it with a root word. Similar to stemming, but more accurate.\n",
    "* Stopword Removal: Remove tokens that don't contribute meaning. For example, \"the\" is meaningless on its own.\n",
    "* Identifying Outliers: Identify and possibly remove non-standard \"words\" like numbers, mispellings, code, etc...\n",
